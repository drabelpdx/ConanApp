      description: "<p>With the echoing war drums of the Pict tribes settled
        beyond the Black River and the increased frequency of incursions up to
        the Thunder River, many settlers flee the Conajohara territory for the
        safer lands of the Kingdom of Aquilonia.</p>
        <p>While scouting along the border to aid Valannus, the Commander of Fort
        Tuscelan, Conan bears witness to the massacre of a column of refugees from
        Velitrium. The Picts withdraw victoriously with a female prisoner who Conan
        recognizes as Yselda, the daughter of the city’s governor. The Cimmerian
        knows that Yselda’s life can now be measured in mere hours, as she will
        shortly be sacrificed on the altar of Jhebbal Sag, the Lord of Beasts.
        Back in Fort Tuscelan, Conan assembles a small group of experienced
        warriors to rescue the governor’s daughter and, at Valannus’ request,
        bring back the head of Zogar Sag.</p>",

        During setup, the Overlord secretly chooses one numbered token
        corresponding to a numbered hut in the setup diagram and sets it aside
        facedown. The first time a hero enters the chosen hut, the Overlord flips
        the token faceup and places Yselda’s model in the hut’s area. Yselda is
        unconscious, counts as an object with an encumbrance value of 6, and can
        be picked up by a hero by performing a simple manipulation. That hero takes
        the <img src="https://drabelpdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Conan/tiles/ThalisToken.png"
        class="scen_token"> and places it next to their character sheet. Yselda
        has one life point and no armor. She dies if she suffers any damage
        (such as an area attack). If she dies, the side which killed her
        immediately loses the game.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Zogar Sag:</span>
        He cannot flee the village. When Zogar Sag dies, place his life point
        marker <img src="https://drabelpdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Conan/tiles/ZogarSagToken.png"
        class="scen_token"> in his area to represent his head. A hero may pick
        the head up by performing a simple manipulation. That hero places Zogar
        Sag’s life point marker next to its character sheet. Zogar Sag’s head
        has an encumbrance value of 2.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Fleeing the Village:</span>
        A hero can flee the village from an area at the edge of the board by
        spending movement points as though the hero were moving across a border
        and removing the hero’s model from the board. Once a hero has fled, the
        hero’s model cannot be returned to the board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Hut Flaps:</span>
        A character must spend 1 extra movement point to move across a border
        into or out of a hut. Moving across an opening token does not cost an
        extra movement point.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Wooden Huts:</span>
        A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/11">Wall Wrecker</a>
        can use it to move across the wall of one of the wooden huts.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Climbing:</span>
        A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a> can move
        across boulders <img src="/assets/tokens/rocksToken.png" class="scen_token" />
        as though they were a border by spending 2 extra movement points.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Chests:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places 1 chest in each hut area (8 total).

        daughter of King Ophir, is set upon by Kothian soldiers. The detachment
        assigned to protect her is massacred. After reaping a bloody harvest,
        even Conan succumbs to the overwhelming numbers and the fury of a
        strange man-ape.</p>
        <p>Now Conan and Olivia are prisoners of Captain Arbanus, right hand of
        King Strabonus of Koth. In his quest to control the gold mines which
        feed King Ophir’s wealth, Strabonus has turned to kidnapping and
        extortion over costly military action. Conan paces in his cell like a
        caged lion. His incandescent blue eyes search for any means of escape,
        and he rages at his failure to protect the princess.</p>
        <p>The Kothians have fallen back to an old fortification on the border
        of the two kingdoms. As they take defensive positions and install deadly
        machines of war, the Cimmerian’s brothers-in-arms mount a rescue mission.
        King Ophir’s message is clear: his daughter must not fall into Strabonus’
        hands alive.</p>",

        crew of The Vandal. Soon, his personality and sailing prowess make him
        popular with the crew, and his leadership gains him the attention of
        Sancha, the Zingaran mercenary’s favorite.</p>
        <p>Zaporavo remains wary of the Cimmerian, who he now sees as a rival.
        But the time is not right to settle scores as the sails of an Argosian
        merchant vessel appear on the horizon. The Vandal’s crew sets upon its
        prey, and the merchant ship offers little resistance. With the captured
        vessel intact, Zaporavo sets sail to the nearest Zingaran port, hoping to
        profit as much from the ship itself as from its cargo.</p>
        <p>Aboard the Argosian ship and flanked by crew members loyal to him, Conan
        seizes the opportunity and incites a mutiny, hoping to take the ship and

      description: "<p>The situation is dire. The Aquilonian province of
        Conajohara is on the brink of collapse, drowned under the assault of
        the unified Pict tribes led by Zogar Sag. For days, Conan and his band
        of scouts have prowled the Black River, fighting fiercely to protect the
        settlers fleeing the destruction.</p>
        <p>Reaching a small village, the scouts find the population slaughtered.
        On some corpses, the skin is shriveled and blackened, while other bodies
        have been mutilated by some terrible beast. “This is the work of Zogar Sag,”
        Conan grunts. “He commands wild beasts, and I have seen others fall victim
        to the black death of the swamps before.” They head back toward the river.</p>
        <p>At dusk, they come upon another village. It remains intact, though
        deserted. Exhausted, the scouts turn in for the night, though Conan issues
        a warning: “Rest assured that the Picts will soon arrive to wipe this
        place from the map. Rest while you can, for tomorrow we make them pay for
        their crimes!”</p>
        <p>When the red dawn rises, even Conan has slipped into slumber. Civilization
        has not dulled his instinct, however, and he is awake before the first Pict
        manages to slip into the village.</p>",

        A hero in a hut area can perform a complex Manipulation to search the

        • If the card is an objective, all heroes can look at it. The heroes
        decide whether to discard the card faceup or keep the card facedown.</p>

        When a Pict Warrior, Pict Hunter, or Zogar Sag</a> is activated, if that

        The Overlord adds 1 flame to that hut for each symbol shown on the die;
        use flame tokens <img src="/assets/tokens/flameToken.png" class="scen_token" />

        for each flame in that area. The dice cannot be rerolled. Then each hero
        in that area suffers damage equal to the number of symbols shown on the

        The Vandal has made port in Pelishtim and its captain, Zaporavo, has
        found a copy of the texts of Vathelos the Blind. Legends tell that the
        texts contain secrets to opening the doors to the shimmering dome that
        looms above the ancient ruins of Kuthchemes in the vast deserts of
        south-western Shem.</p>
        <p>“The promise of fabulous treasure for whomever has the courage to claim
        the text,” recites Shevatas, king of the thieves of Zamora. The words echo
        in Conan’s ears as the two men meet at the inn where Zaporavo is staying.
        Their plan is simple: wait until nightfall, find where the texts are hidden,
        and claim the texts and the treasure for themselves.</p>
        <p>Celebration fills the air as the crew of The Vandal crowds the inn,
        spending loot on alcohol and women. But the crewmen are soon joined by
        Shemite soldiers, whom Zaporavo has paid off to watch his back.</p>
        <p>When Zaporavo realizes the identity of the pair of newcomers, the inn
        turns into a death trap.</p>",

      description: "<p>A relentless hail of arrows flies from the forest to crash
      upon the palisade of Fort Tuscelan. Hordes of naked silhouettes, covered in
      ritual paints, surround the fort. The Black River swarms with their canoes.</p>
      <p>Howling like wolves, hundreds of ferocious Picts surge from the edge of
      the wood and begin an assault on the gates and the ramparts, defended under
      torchlight by Aquilonian soldiers.</p>
      <p>A group of warriors observes the scene from a distance. “Are we going to
      cut our way into the fort?” asks one of Conan’s companions. The Cimmerian
      shakes his head and announces, with a serious tone: “The fort is done for,
      but we can still warn and save the settlers located between the fort and the
      Thunder River. The Picts, drunk with blood, will swarm Eastward.”</p>
      <p>As the warriors run along the road leading to Velitrium, they reach the
      Scalp, a small river beyond which the first settlements can be found. But
      to their great surprise, the Picts have outpaced them, probably a small
      detachment unwilling to wait until the fort is taken and wanting to surprise
      the settlers in their beds to more easily massacre them.</p>
      <p>Conan and his companions at arms rush to save the villagers at the same
      moment Zogar Sag, leading the warriors, let out a hideous cry. A few moments
      later, a legendary monster appears – a creature known to have disappeared
      long ago: the terrifying Serpent-Specter.</p>",

      under difficult conditions in the head of the bay of Korvela, along the coast
      which borders the Pict territory, far in the north of the kingdom of Zingara.
      They have followed their employer, Count Valenso Korzetta, who has exiled
      himself far from civilization for reasons known only to himself.</p>
      <p>They are soon joined by the mercenary captain Zaporavo, an acquaintance
      of count Korzetta, who has come with his crew to lend a hand in exchange for
      glittering gold.</p>
      <p>As everyone is working to improve the defenses of the colony against the
      Pict threat, they discover an ancient citadel which holds the mythic treasure
      of Tranicos the Bloodthirsty, the most famous pirate the Baracha Isles have
      ever known.</p>
      <p>Zaporavo, little disposed to share the loot, attempts to claim it and
      takes advantage of the absence of the bulk of the troops to get rid of the
      few guards left posted on location. Only Conan, the warrior Valeria, and
      Taurus can interpose themselves, but they are quickly overwhelmed by Zaporavo’s
      forces.</p>
      <p>After sounding the alarm horn, Valeria and Taurus barely had enough time
      to hide themselves, but Conan is captured and tossed in a pit filled with
      hyenas.</p>",

      description: "<p>The clangor of the swords has died away, the shouting of
      the slaughter was hushed; silence lay on the red-stained snow. The bleak
      pale sun that glittered so blindingly from the ice-fields and the snow-covered
      plains struck sheens of silver from rent corselet and broken blade, where the
      dead lay as they had fallen. The nerveless hand yet gripped the broken hilt;
      helmeted heads back-drawn in the death-throes, tilted red beards and golden
      beards grimly upward, as if in last invocation to Ymir the frost-giant, god
      of a warrior-race.</p>
      <p>Robert E. Howard – The Frost-Giant’s Daughter.</p>
      <p>In the novel from Robert E. Howard, once the last of the Vanir warrior
      defeated, Conan rushed after the strange woman with an ivory skin who appeared
      before his eyes as he regained consciousness. What if after this battle, Conan
      had lingered there just a bit longer instead of pursuing Atali? He would have
      witnessed the paralyzing sight of the cold dead fingers around him taking up
      their bloody arms again. He would have seen the proud Warriors from the North
      rise, freed from the grip of death and ready to fight for another master: a
      necromancer and his undead horde, awakened by the crash of combat and the smell
      of blood and ruin.</p>",

      <p>He did not wonder at the strangeness of it all, not even when two gigantic
      figures rose up to bar his way. The scales of their mail were white with
      hoar-frost; their helmets and their axes covered with ice. Snow sprinkled
      their locks; in their beards were spikes of icicles; their eyes were cold
      as the lights that streamed above them.</p>
      <p>“Brothers!” Cried the girl, dancing between them. “Look who follows! I
      have brought you a man to slay! Take his heart that we may lay it smoking
      on our father’s board!” The giants answered with roars like the grinding of
      ice-bergs on a frozen shore and heaved up their shining axes as the maddened

      <p>With a cry of fright she turned and ran fleetly. She did not laugh now,
      nor mock him over her white shoulder. She ran as for her life, and though
      he strained every nerve and thew, until his temples were like to burst and
      the snow swam red to his gaze, she drew away from him, dwindling in the
      witch-fire of the skies, until she was a figure no bigger than a child,
      then a dancing white flame on the snow, then a dim blur in the distance.
      But grinding his teeth until the blood started from his gums, he reeled on,
      and he saw the blur of him, and slowly the space narrowed, foot by foot.</p>

        on space 6 of the track sheet. This is used to track Atali’s Armor value

        At the start of each Overlord’s turn before the Recovery Phase, if
        Atali is in an area where at least 1 gem is placed, the Overlord must
        transfer 1 gem from their Reserve zone to that area of the game board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">A Weakening Magic:</span>
        Atali’s Life Points are represented by the gems in the Overlord’s Reserve
        and Fatigue zones. When Atali suffers damage, the Overlord must transfer
        that many gems from their Reserve zone and place them in Atali’s area on
        the game board. When the Overlord’s Reserve zone is empty, use gems from the
        Overlord’s Fatigue zone. If the Overlord’s Fatigue zone is also empty, Atali
        dies and the hero wins. Each time Atali suffers damage, the Overlord may move
        Atali to any area on the board. This Move action cannot be hindered by the hero
        and Atali is not affected by the movement penalty when entering
        Impenetrable Forest or Rocky Outcrop.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Mortal Exhaustion:</span>
        Each time the Overlord uses gems to activate a tile, or uses a spell,
        the Overlord places the first gem used in Atali’s area on the game board,
        and the rest in their Fatigue zone. Gems spent to cast The Weight of Years
        count toward the spell exertion limit. Gems used for Benefits (Defense,
        Movement, Rerolls) are all moved to the Overlord’s Fatigue zone as normal.</p>

      description: "<p>Conan has reached the kingdom of Khitai and the city of
      Paikang, the town of purple towers whose sumptuous pagodas overlook the
      bamboo jungles adorned with lianas.</p>
      <p>The Cimmerian has ventured deep into the East, through the vast Hyrkanian
      steppe to escape from the Turanian army. He is one of the only survivors
      of a troop of five thousand ferocious Kozaki fighters defeated on the
      riverbank of the Ilbars river; the Turanians relentlessly hunting the
      remaining pillagers.</p>
      In Paikang, it did not take long for the barbarian to make a name for
      himself; this caused him to be hired by a well-known sorcerer determined
      to get rid of Shuang Mian, a sinister rival who became a nuisance for his
      business. Conan heads to the sorcerer’s dwellings guided by Shentu, a
      Khitan mercenary know to be as deadly as he is audacious.</p>
      Shuang Mian lives in a district of Paikang, in a heavily guarded tower.
      However, it would be too easy for the mercenaries to simply enter the tower
      and kill the sorcerer. They also have to rob valuable documents and plant a
      false evidence behind them to mislead any investigation into concluding that
      Shuang Mian was assassinated out of revenge. In the darkest hour of the night,
      the small group gets closer to the tower </p>",

        When Shuang Mian’s tile is activated, the Overlord may move 2 gems from their
        Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone to create a double identical to the sorcerer.
        The Overlord places a second life token
        <img src="https://drabelpdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Conan/tiles/ShuangMianToken.png" class="scen_token">
         in Shuang Mian’s area; this represents the sorcerer’s double. When Shuang
        Mian moves, the Overlord moves the life token to the same area. When Shuang
        Mian is attacked, after the attack power is determined, the Overlord
        secretly places a gem taken from the Energy gems left in the box in one
        of their hands and presents them to the attacker. The attacker chooses
        one hand: if the selected hand contains the gem, Shuang Mian is hit by
        the attack and the attack is resolved normally. If the selected hand
        does not contain the gem, the sorcerer’s double is hit by the attack and
        the attack ends. The effect of Ethereal Twin ends and the life token is
        removed from Shuang Mian’s area. The effect of Ethereal Twin remains
        active until the sorcerer’s double is hit by an attack and cannot be
        used if already active.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Hidden in the Shadows:</span>
        When a minion dies, lay the minion’s model down in the model’s area instead
        of removing the model from the board. This dead minion does not count for
        Hindering. If a hero is in an area with a dead minion and there are no
        living enemy characters in the area, the hero can perform a simple Manipulation
        to remove a dead minion’s model from the board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Alert Level:</span>
        The Alert Level is increased by 1 if:
        At the beginning of the Overlord’s turn, after the Recovery phase, a unit
        is in an area with a hero.
        During the Overlord’s turn, a unit moves into an area with one or more
        dead minions. After increasing the Alert Level, remove all the dead minions’
        models in that area from the board.</p>
        <p>The Alert Level may increase multiple times during the Overlord’s turn.
        The Alert Level can only increase once per area per turn. Each time the
        Alert Level increases, the Overlord replaces the numbered token on their
        recovery token with a numbered token of a value equal to the new Alert Level</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">The Master Key:</span>
        The <a class="item" href="/items/72">Tower Key</a> opens any door or
        chest in the tower. A hero in an area adjacent to a door or in the
        chest’s area can discard the Tower Key to open that door or that chest.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">False Evidence:</span>
        A hero with the <a class="item" href="/items/68">False Evidence</a>
        asset card in the chest’s area on level 4 of the tower, may place that
        card in the area by performing a simple Manipulation. This validates a
        secondary objective for the heroes.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Shuang Mian’s Documents:</span>
        During setup, the <a class="item" href="/items/74">Warlock Documents</a>
        asset card is placed in the chest’s area on level 2 of the tower. A hero
        in that area may perform a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 2
        to rob the documents. If successful, that hero takes the Warlock Documents
        asset card. This validates a secondary objective of the heroes.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Table and Stairs:</span>
        The stairs provide an Elevation bonus for Ranged Attacks against an enemy
        on a lower area. A character with or without
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/16">Leap</a> or
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a> may move onto the table on
        level 2 of the tower by spending 1 extra movement point. That area
        provides an Elevation bonus. A character in the table’s area,
        with or without <a class="skill" href="/skills/1">Reach</a>, may attack
        a character in an adjacent area with a Melee Attack. That area does not
        block line of sight.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Climbing:</span>
        A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a> may:
        Move from level 1 to level 2 (and the other way) by climbing the tree
        and spending 1 extra movement point.
        Move from level 2 to level 3 (and the other way) or from level 3 to
        level 4 (and the other way) by climbing the outside walls of the tower
        and spending 2 extra movement points.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Doors:</span>
        A character in an area adjacent to a door on levels 1 and 3 of the tower
        may perform a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 2 to open it. The
        Overlord’s units other than the Foo Dogs may move through those doors freely.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Windows:</span>
        During setup, place 3&nbsp;<img src="/assets/tokens/rocksToken.png" class="scen_token" />
        tokens as indicated by the setup diagram. These windows are sealed off
        and cannot be opened, even with the Tower Key. The windows on levels 2 and 3 have
        line of sight on the areas of level 1 directly below them.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Stone Wall:</span>
        A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/11">Wall Wrecker</a>
        cannot use it to move across an outer wall of the tower or a stone wall.</p>

      description: "<p>After executing their target and planting false evidence
      to distract any investigation, Conan and his companions are ready to leave
      the tower as discreetly as they got in.</p>
      <p>A stroke of bad luck placed them in a difficult situation. A zealous
      guard started his patrol earlier and found himself face to face with the
      small gang. The sound of the alarm instigated a fight as brutal as it was
      short and lead to the capture of Conan and his men. They were all sent to
      rot in the underground level of the tower.</p>
      But no chain can hold the Cimmerian barbarian back for long, and thanks to
      his strength, the prisoners are now free. Unfortunately, they accidently
      knocked a torch down in their violent struggle with the guard and started
      a fire. The flames, probably stoked by the powders and strange potions
      brewed by the sorcerer set the basement and the first floor ablaze, blocking
      the exit through the main doors.</p>
      If they want to escape, Conan and his allies have no choice. They will have
      to reach the roof and jump in the pond at the foot of the tower. But to their
      surprise, on their way to the top floor, while fighting the guards, they
      come across Shuang Mian!</p>
      Which sort of evil allowed the sorcerer to survive, Conan will never know,
      but he gives out a ferocious battle cry as he leaps in the flames, his axe
      in hand, determined to finish the contract.</p>",

        The fire progresses upward after the End phase of the heroes’ turn:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>At the end of turn 1, the level 0 is on fire</li>
          <li>At the end of turn 3, the level 1 is on fire</li>
          <li>At the end of turn 5, the level 2 is on fire</li>
          <li>At the end of turn 6, the level 3 is on fire</li>
          <li>At the end of turn 7, the level 4 is on fire and the whole tower is burning in flames.</li>

        A model in a level or moving into a level on fire is immediately removed from the game.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Exiting the Tower:</span><br />

        <ul>
          <li>Level 0: A character other than a Foo Dog may move across the heroes’ cell door
          as though it were a border by spending 1 additional movement point. After a
          character moves across that door, remove that door from the board.</li>
          <li>Level 0: The portcullis is locked. A character in the area adjacent to the
          portcullis may perform a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 2 to open
          it. Once opened a character can move through it with no movement penalty.</li>
          <li>Level 1: A character cannot move across the main doors.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Climbing:</span>
        A character with Climb may move from level 2 to level 3 (and the other way)
        or from level 3 to level 4 (and the other way) by climbing the outside
        walls of the tower and spending 2 extra movement points. That character
        cannot reach level 1 by climbing because of the flames.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Windows:</span>
        During setup, place 2&nbsp;<img src="/assets/tokens/rocksToken.png" class="scen_token" />
        tokens as indicated by the setup diagram. These windows are sealed off
        and cannot be opened. The windows on levels 2 and 3 have line of sight
        on the areas of level 1 directly below them.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Shuang Mian:</span>
        The Overlord cannot move Shuang Mian into a level on fire to prevent the
        heroes from killing him. When Shuang Mian dies, remove his model and place
        his life token
        <img src="https://drabelpdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Conan/tiles/ShuangMianToken.png" class="scen_token">
          in the same area. This represents his head. A hero in the head’s area
         may perform a simple manipulation to pick it up. The head has an
         encumbrance value of 2.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Call to Arms:</span>
        When Shuang Mian’s tile is activated,
        the Overlord may move 2 gems from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone
        to summon his loyal hound. The Evil Hound’s tile must replace a facedown
        tile. The Evil Hound’s model is place in Shuang Mian’s area or in an adjacent
        area and his life point token
        <img src="https://drabelpdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Conan/tiles/DarkDemonToken.png" class="scen_token">
         is placed on space 2 of the turn track.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Dive:</span>
        A character in an area marked with the Leap
        <img src="/assets/skills/Leap.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> icon may leap
        in the pond’s area of level 1 by spending 1 extra movements point. The

        <img src="/assets/dice/Orange.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> dice

        <a class="skill" href="/skills/16">Leap</a>, the character rolls 1
        Orange <img src="/assets/dice/Orange.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> die
        instead</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Fleeing the Tower:</span>
        A hero can flee the tower from one of the outdoor areas of level 1 by
        spending movement points as though the hero were moving across a border
        and removing the hero’s model from the board. Once a hero has fled, the
        hero’s model cannot be returned to the board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Table and Stairs:</span>
        The stairs provide an Elevation bonus for Ranged Attacks against an enemy
        on a lower area. A character with or without
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/16">Leap</a> or
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a> may move onto the table on
        level 2 of the tower by spending 1 extra movement point. That area
        provides an Elevation bonus. A character in the table’s area,
        with or without <a class="skill" href="/skills/1">Reach</a>, may attack
        a character in an adjacent area with a Melee Attack. That area does not
        block line of sight.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Stone Wall:</span>
        A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/11">Wall Wrecker</a>
        cannot use it to move across an outer wall of the tower or a stone wall.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">End of Game Scoring:</span>
        The Heroes and the Overlord keep track of the Victory Points earned at

        second copy of the ingredients (except the Warlock Blood) as indicated
        in the setup diagram.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">The Blood of the Warlock:</span>
        The first time Shuang Mian loses at least 1 life point from a Melee Attack,
        place the card <a class="item" href="/items/75">Warlock’s Blood</a> in
        Shuang Mian’s area. It can be picked up by performing a simple Manipulation.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Collecting Ingredients:</span>
        A hero in an ingredient’s area (except the Warlock’s Blood) may perform
        a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 2 to find it in the room. That
        hero immediately picks up that ingredient. Warlock’s Blood and the urns
        containing the ingredients are fragile and cannot be thrown. The heroes
        may give or pick up an ingredient.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Fleeing the Town:</span>
        A hero can flee the town from the top-right area of the board by spending
        movement points as though the hero were moving across a border and removing
        the hero’s model from the board. Once a hero has fled, the hero’s model
        cannot be returned to the board.</p>

        A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/11">Wall Wrecker</a>
        cannot move through the reinforced walls of the barracks (south of the
        board) and the smoking room (north of the board)</p>

        The areas with boats are considered normal terrain for Movement.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Swimming:</span>
        A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/13">Swimming</a> may
        move through the areas of water next to the cemetery.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Leap:</span>

        fails to leap, the character remains in its area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Chests:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places 2 chests on the board as indicated by
        the setup diagram. The asset deck contains:

      description: "<p>A deceptive calm covers the small town nestled in the meanders
      of the river as the peace will soon give way to the chaos of steel and battle
      cries.</p>
      <p>The mighty sorcerer who reigns over the vicinity decided to make an
      example out of the town that refused to pay exorbitant cost for his protection.
      Well versed in the dark arts, the sorcerer now wants to show his terrible
      powers to remind everyone that he cannot be besmirched without consequence.</p>
      <p>But when the troops of the sorcerer invade the streets to put to the sword
      every inhabitant and destroy the place, three  mercenaries emerged from the
      shadows, weapon in hand. Even if the villagers had not much to offer, they
      rallied the black haired mercenary coming from the edge of the world to their
      cause. This powerful warrior is accompanied by a Khitan named Shentu, known
      to be a fierce swordsman, and a priest whose enchantments have marveled the
      inhabitants of these eastern lands.</p>
      <p>Facing such a large number of assailants, the mercenaries decided to cut
      the head of the snake and kill the sorcerer as soon as they can. However,
      he has already transformed into an evil creature with membranous wings. His
      terrifying dark magic is strongly powered by artifacts placed at the four
      corners of the town. It will be very difficult to eliminate the sorcerer
      without destroying the artifacts first.</p>",

      disappeared.</p>
      <p>To save his kingdom, on which the banners of the Nemedian Dragon now
      flutter, the Cimmerian has traveled to Stygia, a dark region of sorcery and
      unspeakable horrors. He left to look for the Heart of Ahriman, a magical
      jewel needed to defeat the sorcerer Xaltotun, the powerful partisan of the
      plotters, and take back the reins of what is rightfully his.</p>
      <p>So, the uncrowned king went after Thuthtmes, a priest of Set who also
      covet the legendary gem for his own. Conan’s trail then vanished somewhere
      between the port town of Khemi and the capital city of Luxur, as he might
      have been imprisoned.</p>
      <p>But all hope is not lost. A small group of adventures who remained loyal
      to King Conan have followed his trail to the doorstep of Luxur and its massive,
      bleak, and oppressive buildings, typical of the local architecture. Lead by
      Ikhmet, a renegade Stygian assassin, not very concerned about is employer’s
      identity as long as he is well paid, the king’s followers have found the
      entrance to a complex network of underground caves alongside the river Styx.
      This is where they believe Conan to be held.</p>
      <p>The rumor says that Set himself, the ancient god of chaos, still roams
      in the shadows of the mysterious Stygian temples. But who knows what looms
      in the dark depths of the underground tunnels in which the heroes just entered.</p>",

        area and the hero draws one card from the asset deck. If the well token
        shows a <span class="scen_check">&#x2714;</span>, the token is placed
        faceup in that area and represents the open well.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Moving Through a Well:</span>
        A character with or without Climb in the opened well’s area may move from
        level 1 to level 0 (and the other way) by spending 2 extra movement points.
        Moving through a well takes a character’s model to the area with a well
        token directly above or below. The Giant Scorpions
        may move through all the wells, open or not, with no movement penalty.
        The Scorpion Broodmother cannot move through wells.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Moving Through Secret Passages:</span>
        Each level is traversed by a network of secret passages which entrances
        are represented by secret passage tokens
        <img src="/assets/tokens/secretPassageStygiaToken.png" class="scen_token" />.
        A character in an area with a secret passage may move to another area
        with a secret passage of the same level by spending 2 extra movement
        points. To move through a secret passage, both areas with the entrance
        and the exit must be clear of enemies. The Overlord’s units and Ikhmet
        know the nooks of the temple and may move through a secret passage with
        no movement penalty. The Scorpion Broodmother cannot move through secret passages</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Poisoned:</span>
        When attacked by a Giant Scorpion, instead of suffering damage as usual, a
        hero must place a number of poison tokens <img src="/assets/tokens/poisonToken.png" class="scen_token" />
        equal to the amount of damage either on the Melee Attack or the Move space of
        their hero’s sheet. Each poison token on an action space reduces by 1
        the exertion limit of that action. When both exertion limits are reduced
        to zero, that hero immediately dies. If additional poison tokens
        <img src="/assets/tokens/poisonToken.png" class="scen_token" /> are needed,
        you can use any other token to represent them.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Immune:</span>
        A hero with this ability had developed a resistance to poison. At the
        beginning of the Action phase, whether the hero is aggressive or cautious,
        that hero may remove one poison token
        <img src="/assets/tokens/poisonToken.png" class="scen_token" /> from one
        of the action spaces of their hero’s sheet. <a class="hero" href="/heroes/36">Ikhmet </a>
        is Immune for this scenario.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Darkness:</span>
        The maze of tunnels is plunged into an impenetrable darkness. There is no
        line of sight between two different areas of the whole board. Each action
        that requires line of sight can only be performed within a single area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Assassins:</span>
        The Assassins are stealthy. During setup, the Overlord shuffles 6 assassin tokens
        <img src="https://drabelpdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Conan/tiles/AssassinToken.png" class="scen_token">,
        3 with a face showing a <span class="scen_x">X</span>, and 3 with a face
        showing a <span class="scen_check">&#x2714;</span>, and randomly places
        them facedown on the board as indicated by the setup diagram, then looks
        at them secretly. The Overlord may look at the assassins tokens secretly
        anytime during the game. When the Assassin’s tile is activated, the
        Overlord may move all the Assassin models and all the assassin tokens as
        if they were Assassin models. When an Assassin’s token is moved into a
        hero’s area, or when a hero moves into an assassin token’s area, that
        token is revealed. If the token shows a <span class="scen_x">X</span>,
        it was a decoy and that token is discarded. If the token shows a
        <span class="scen_check">&#x2714;</span>, the token is replaced by an
        Assassin model. When all the Assassin models have been placed on the
        board, discard the remaining assassin tokens. Assassin tokens do not
        block secret passages.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Water of Styx:</span>
        The water area is not accessible for this scenario.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Body Search:</span>
        Each time a hero kills an Eternal Guard, that hero may perform a complex
        Manipulation with a difficulty of 1 to search that guard. If successful,
        that hero draws a card from the asset deck. Then that Eternal Guard model
        is removed from the board whether that hero chooses to search it or not.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Reinforcements:</span>
        Reinforcements are placed in an area with a secret passage token in
        level 0 or 1. The reinforcement cost of a model is doubled when a model
        is reinforced in level 0.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">The Scorpion Broodmother:</span>
        When the Scorpion Broodmother tile is activated, the Overlord starts the
        activation by rolling 1 Yellow, 1 Orange, and 1 Red
        <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" />
        <img src="/assets/dice/Orange.png" class="scen_sq_token" />
        <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> die.
        For each symbol shown on the dice, the Overlord may place a
        Giant Scorpion model in the Scorpion Broodmother’s area or in an area
        adjacent to that area. If that area is already occupied (and the model’s
        base cannot fir entirely in the area), the Overlord may place that model
        in an area adjacent to the occupied area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Torch:</span>
        At the beginning of their action phase, a hero in aggressive stance with
        a Torch may discard it to kill all the Giant Scorpion models in that
        hero’s area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Antidote:</span>
        A hero with an Antidote may discard it to remove all the poison tokens
        <img src="/assets/tokens/poisonToken.png" class="scen_token" /> from one
        of the action spaces of their hero’s sheet.</p>

      temple has been slain, but Conan is nowhere to be found. As the adventures
      are about to continue their search, a crazy laugh echoes on the walls of
      the vast cave: This place will be your grave!</p>
      <p>The chilling voice belongs to the instigator of Conan’s disappearance:
      Thot-Amon, the Great Priest of Set himself. He found out that Thuthotmes
      was after the Heart of Ahriman, one of the most powerful artifacts, which
      he planned on using to seize the title of Great Priest for himself and
      dictate his will to King Ctesphon.</p>
      <p>As Conan was getting closer to Thuthotmes, the Great Priest set up a
      false lead to get rid of the Cimmerian and capture the ambitious priest.
      It is said that treachery is common in this dark land, but Thuthotmes will
      have to repent for his betrayal.</p>
      <p>Thot-Amon is cunning. He knew that Conan’s companions would come to try
      rescuing him, so he set up a trap that just closed on them. For Conan’s
      friends, the choice is simple if they want to save him: Defeat Thot-Amon
      or die.</p>",

      to purify the three items by submerging them in the waters of the Styx.</p>

        their hero’s sheet. During the hero’s Recovery phase, each Recovery token
        <img src="/assets/tokens/numBackToken.png" class="scen_token" /> placed next
        to their hero’s sheet counts for a dead hero in terms of Recovery.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Rebellion Level:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places the Rebellion Level tokens
        <img src="/assets/stats/reinforcement.png" class="scen_token" />
        on the position "8" of the turn track. This represents the current
        Rebellion Level.</p>
        <p>The Rebellion Level is decreased by 1 if the hero kills at least two
        models of the Overlord other than
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/54">Amboola</a>,
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/62">Kerim Shah</a> and
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/55">Balthus</a> during
        the same hero’s turn. The Rebellion Level is each time decreased by 2
        when Amboola, Kerim Shah or Balthus dies. The Rebellion Level is each time
        decreased by 1, when
        <a class="hero" href="/heroes/12">Conan</a>
        picks up the <a class="item" href="/items/32">Axe</a>,
        the <a class="item" href="/items/16">Chain Mail</a> or
        the <a class="item" href="/items/46">Cape</a>.
        The Rebellion Level is once increased by 1 when the hero has for the
        first time 6 gems in their Wound zone. The Rebellion Level is increased
        by 1 when both banners are burnt.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Legendary Equipment:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places as indicated by the setup diagram, the
        following Equipment cards:
        <a class="item" href="/items/46">Cape</a>,
        <a class="item" href="/items/16">Chain Mail</a> and
        <a class="item" href="/items/32">Axe</a>. This is Conan’s Legendary
        Equipment which he will have to recover to establish his authority.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Overpowering Conan:</span>
        When the Overlord activates this Event, they chose a tile. All models of
        that tile immediately gain their base move value. The Overlord can use
        the Movement benefit to purchase extra Movement points. Then, the
        Overlord creates a dice pool with an Orange
        <img src="/assets/dice/Orange.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> die for each
        of their models located in the same area as the hero, then rolls that
        dice pool. The hero can then use the guard benefit with no bonus attached
        to the Equipment, Armors included. If the Overlord’s result is superior
        to the hero’s, Conan bends his knees and is considered overpowered. Then,
        the hero removes from the game one of the Recovery tokens which are next
        to their hero’s sheet. If Conan has been overpowered, the
        Event "Overpowering Conan" cannot be performed for the rest of the
        scenario.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Banners:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places on the board two Banner tokens
        <img src="/assets/tokens/numBackToken.png" class="scen_token" />
        as indicated by the setup diagram. If Amboola, Kerim Shah or Balthus are
        in an area with a Banner token, they can target the banner by performing
        a Melee attack and roll at least 3 symbols; the banner is burnt and the
        token is removed from the game. When the second banner is burnt, the hero
        removes from the game one of the Recovery tokens next to their hero’s sheet.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Lines of Sight:</span>
        A character in a wall area has line of sight to each ground area
        within the fortress walls. An area in a tower and an area outside
        that tower are within each other’s line of sight only if the areas
        are in or adjacent to the tower.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Leaping from Walls:</span>
        A character can move across a parapet from a wall area to
        a ground area as though it were a border. The character rolls 2 Red
        <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" />
        <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> dice for

        A character can move into a rock slide area
        <img src="/assets/tokens/rocksToken.png" class="scen_token" /> from an

        <p><span class="special_title">Chests:</span>

        to engender a diplomatic incident with the powerful Aquilonia;
        Zaporavo succeeded in worrying King Numedides. The latter knows all
        too well that Zingara has been trying for a long time to win over him
        the control of this rich region, without daring to launch into an open
        war.</p>
        <p>To put an end to the threat, the Aquilonian king decided to send an
        army corps with at its head the barbarian of the North who underwent
        a dazzling ascent in his troops. However, the king underestimated the
        gravity of the threat, thinking only to be dealing with a group of
        cut-throats led by a renegade in search of redemption. Unless he took
        umbrage at the recent popularity of General Conan. His choice to solely
        send a small contingent ended in failure. His soldiers, fallen in a trap,
        were cut to pieces by the mercenaries, and Conan was captured.</p>
        <p>Since Numedides was not willing to pay any ransom for this general who
        had become too cumbersome, some loyal of Conan decided to go to the
        fortress where he was detained. But Zaporavo had anticipated such a
        reaction, and had provided for a warning system so as to be able to
        gather the Zingaran troops stationed not far from his lair.</p>",

        building, engulfed by the lush vegetation, she has no regrets accepting
        the small fortune that the priest has given her to be escorted to the
        wild shores of the Kush kingdom. Not knowing how to control her greed,
        the Shemite devil, surrounded by a handful of her black buccaneers, has
        followed the priest through the sinister jungle in the hope of discovering
        a much more impressive bounty; she has the feeling that Hadrathus is
        pursuing relics of immeasurable value.</p>
        <p>During his mystical research, Hadrathus has discovered that mirrors
        belonging to the wizard Tuzun Thune of ancient Valusia are still intact.
        They could help him call into question Reality as we know it, thus giving

      description: "<p>Conan and his men have journeyed for several hours from
        Velitrium, the raw, turbulent frontier town situated on the banks of
        Thunder River. There, on the western border of the kingdom of Aquilonia,
        the Cimmerian thinks back to the time of the end of Conajohara. This
        province was slowly conquered from wild Pictish territory, whose people
        were pushed back beyond the Black River in a succession of bloody
        massacres.</p>
        <p>Returning to Aquilonia after many years of adventure, Conan has been
        given a command position in King Numedides’ army. He has not forgotten
        Zogar Sag, the sinister shaman who unified the tribes and enabled the lost
        territory to be reclaimed. Fort Tuscelan, then the most western fortress of
        Aquilonia, was wiped off the map, and many settlers and soldiers perished
        at the hands of the Picts who were drunk with revenge and fury.</p>
        <p>If General Conan and a company of Bossonian infantry patrol the border
        today, it is because the Picts are once again restless and the Cimmerian
        has wanted to come and inspect the zones on the banks of the Thunder himself.
        As the company stops in the ruins of a village once destroyed by the Picts,
        warriors wearing war paint suddenly appear and fall upon the soldiers who
        have neither seen nor heard them emerge from the age-old forest.</p>
        <p>Suddenly the blood of the Cimmerian freezes as the incarnation of a
        nightmarish legend with its spectral-hued coat pads into the village. A
        creature almost as big as a bear and with demonic ferocity... a sabertooth tiger.</p>",

      the priest of Asura named Hadrathus follows on the heels of the sinister
      King-Priest who reigned over Kuthchemes three thousand years ago. The
      resurrection of the latter did not go unnoticed in the eyes of those who
      watch the activity of the cult of Set. For, if today Set no longer exerts
      a hold over the world as in the past; the return of one of its most faithful
      and ferocious followers could announce the advent of a new dark age.</p>
      <p>This is why the disciples of Asura decided to strike as soon as they got
      wind of the return of Thugra Khotan. He who reigned in terror and blood,
      sacrificing hundreds of captives to the great glory of the Serpent-God.
      Unable to raise enough men, in the kingdom where Set is still venerated and
      so as to put an end to the threat; the disciples of Asura chose to send the
      best of them, accompanied by Conan; an excellent tracker and a redoubtable warrior.</p>
      <p>It is not far from the sanctuary of Set, the oasis of Aphaka, that both
      men join the one who is now known as Natohk. After coming back to life and
      in a hurry to recover his terrible powers, he hid in this remote place to
      reenergize and prepare for his return. Unfortunately, and to Hadrathus
      greatest surprise, the vile sorcerer already has enough power to raise the
      dead, even if to that end he must use magical artifacts.</p>",

        waters of the great Pelishtim city of Asgalun. After a fruitful campaign
        of bloody robbery and violent pillaging against the Stygian ships; Bêlit,
        a fiery Shemite captain, and Conan, her lieutenant and lover from the
        dismal hills of Cimmeria, have decided to have a good time squandering
        the booty that they have forcefully amassed.</p>
        <p>After days of drunkenness, spent in the company of the worst scoundrels
        hanging around in the most disreputable port alleys of Asgalun; the two
        terrible lovers have learned a secret. There are two carracks flying the
        Zingaran flag among the ships anchored in the port that are carrying an
        exceptional treasure - two finely worked amulets that belonged to the
        monarchs of the ancient kingdom of Acheron. The jewels represent a fabulous
        fortune.</p>
        <p>Bêlit’s greed, and the present lack of action of the Cimmerian, means
        that it doesn’t take them long to rush head first into a new glorious
        exploit of which they hold the secret. The plan: swim out to the ships,

        block the harbor entrance with the second ship to prevent any attempt of
        pursuit. The Tigress is waiting for them close by and ready to sail.</p>",

      special_rules: '<p><span class="special_title">Sinking a Ship:</span>
        Only one ship may be sunk during the scenario. There are two different
        ways a hero can sink a ship:<br />
        • A hero in a reinforcement token’s area <img src="/assets/stats/reinforcement.png" class="scen_token" />
        may perform a complex manipulation with a difficulty of 5 to sink that ship.<br />
        • A hero can throw or drop an <a class="item" href="/items/6">Explosive Orb</a>
        on a reinforcement token’s area <img src="/assets/stats/reinforcement.png" class="scen_token" />.
        The orb explodes normally and that ship sinks.</p>
        <p>When a ship is sunk, the Overlord removes from the river the event
        tile whose number corresponds to the sunken ship. The Overlord also removes
        the sunken ship’s reinforcement token from the board. The Overlord can no
        longer use reinforcement on this area.<br />
        All models without <a class="skill" href="/skills/13">Swimming</a> who
        are present on the sunken ship are swept away with the wreck and are
        immediately removed from the board. The areas of the sunken ship are now
        considered as being water areas for the rest of the scenario. The chest
        tokens and their asset cards remain on the areas where they were
        previously found. The heroes can no longer sink the other ship.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Water Area:</span>
        A model on a water area can still fight without penalty. Characters with
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/13">Swimming</a> can move from one water
        area to the adjacent water for 1 extra movement point. A model (with or
        without <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a>)on a water area can
        climb up onto an adjacent ship area for 2 extra movement points. A
        character that does not have Swimming cannot move from one water area to
        another water area, but can climb up onto an adjacent ship area by
        spending an extra 2 movement points.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title"> Grapnel:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places the Grapnel token
        <img src="/assets/tokens/numBackToken.png" class="scen_token" />
        on the board as indicated by the setup diagram. A model on a water
        zone can climb up onto an adjacent ship area that contains the Grapnel
        token without spending additional movement points.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Alarm:</span>
        During the Overlord’s turn, they can activate only 0 or 1 tile. As soon
        as a ship is sunk, the alarm is raised and the Overlord can normally
        activate 0, 1 or 2 tiles.</p>
        <p><span class="special_title">Reinforcement:</span>
        If all the models of an Overlord’s unit tile have been killed, the
        Overlord can no longer bring in the models of this unit in a
        reinforcement event.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Fleeing:</span>
        The heroes must sink one of the ships to flee with the other
        one. If at least one of the heroes, with both
        <a class="item" href="/items/89">amulets</a> in their possession, is alone
        on a ship (without any of the Overlord’s models present on the ship) at
        the end of a heroes’ turn, they can flee with the ship and the heroes
        win the game.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Jump:</span>
        If a hero or one of the Overlord’s units fails to leap, they fall into
        the water and their model is placed in the water area above which they
        tried to leap. The heroes or the Overlord can decide to fall directly
        into the water without spending additional movement points. This action
        does not require any particular skill.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Chests:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places 4 chests on the board
        as indicated by the setup diagram. The asset deck contains:
        1&nbsp;<a class="item" href="/items/6">Explosive Orb</a>,
        1&nbsp;<a class="item" href="/items/22">Life Potion</a> and 2
        <a class="item" href="/items/89">Amulets</a>. A hero must perform a
        complex manipulation with a difficulty of 3 to open a chest in a water
        area.</p>',

        ferocious warriors of the Panther clan, who treacherously captured him
        the day before.</p>
        <p>Weary of his royal obligations and state affairs, Conan found a pretext

        Thandara where several Aquilonian colonists settled after the fall of the
        Conajohara. The Thandara, the one who in the old days at once stood up for

        imminent sacrifice. But he also knows that he can rely on another prisoner

        <p><span class="special_title">Stone:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places a Stone token
        <img src="/assets/tokens/rocksToken.png" class="scen_token" /> in each of
        the stone Huts as indicated by the setup diagram. These stones are considered
        Equipment cards with an encumbrance value of 2. When a hero carries a stone,
        they no longer suffer the penalty for Melee Attack without a weapon card.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Zogar Sag:</span>
        When <a class="tile" href="/tiles/8">Zogar Sag</a> dies, the Overlord

        an area adjacent to the door can perform a complex Manipulation with a

        A model can flee the village from one of the three village entrance
        areas (northwest, southwest and east) by spending movement points
        as though the model was moving across a border. The model is then removed
        from the board. Once a model has fled, the model cannot be returned to the

        the Sorcerer, a mighty mage of Koth’s court. Centenary codices, discovered
        in the pre-human ruins of the Dagoth hill, took him to Stygia on the trail
        of the fabulous gem called the Heart of Ahriman. Joining forces with an
        old Aquilonian who, like him, wanted to find the artifact so as to shelter
        it; together they defeated vile servants of Set who haunted the forgotten
        tomb in which the Heart was buried.</p>
        <p>To regain Khorshemish, they boarded a merchant ship sailing towards Shem.
        Suddenly, as their boat leaves the coast of Stygia, the look-out lets-out
        an alert cry. A long mortal form appeared on starboard, a serpentine and
        slender galley, rapidly propelled by forty oars on each side. At the top
        of its mast, a long scarlet pennon floats. “By Ishtar!” yells the captain,
        turning pale, “It’s the Tigress! The ship of this she-devil named Bêlit.”</p>
        <p>The captain’s exhortations to the crew are in vain. No maneuver will prevent
        the boarding. “We are lost, the Queen of the Black Coast gives no quarter.”
        At these words, one glance is enough for Pelias to indicate Zelata that
        he has no choice but to use his most powerful invocation, but also the
        riskier one, so that all have a chance to defend the ship, as well as their
        lives.</p>",

          occupied. The heroes place Thaug’s Life Point marker on the position
          “8” of the turn track. The heroes place the Thaug’s tile next to their

          can perform Melee Attacks and may use the red gems on its tile to cast
          spells.<br />
          If Thaug is on the board at the end of the heroes’ turn, the heroes move

          Armor Value of 1 and 1 Life point. Sailors cannot be activated nor
          defended but can be the target of the heroes’ attacks as well as of

          Mitra’s Staff is destroyed.<br />
          During setup, the hero controlling Zelata places 2 red gems on the
          Mitra’s Staff card. The hero controlling Zelata may use the
          gems placed on the Mitra’s Staff card only to cast spells. When the hero
          controlling Zelata uses these red gems, they move them from the
          Mitra’s Staff card to the Spell card. These gems count towards the Spell
          card’s Exertion Limit. The hero controlling Zelata may use both red gems
          from the Mitra’s Staff and their own Energy gems to cast a spell. During
          the End phase of the Heroes’ turn, the hero controlling Zelata moves
          the red gems from the Spell cards to the Mitra’s Staff card. The red
          gems of the Mitra’s Staff are never taken into account when calculating
          Zelata’s life points.</p>

      <span class="special_title">Invocation:</span>
        At the end of turn 5, the Overlord removes from the board all their models
        located in an area of their choice where one of their model with Spell
        Caster is also located, including the Spell Caster’s model. The number of
        models removed from the board corresponds to the number of life points of
        the <a class="tile" href="/tiles/81">Swamp Demon</a>. The Overlord places
        the Swamp Demon Life Point marker
        <img src="https://drabelpdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Conan/tiles/SwampDemonToken.png"
        class="scen_token">on the corresponding position of the turn track. Then,
        the Overlord replaces the removed Spell Caster’s tile in the River with
        the Swamp Demon’s tile.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Deliverance:</span>
          A hero in the same area as one of the Sorcerers under Domination (
          <a class="tile" href="/tiles/60">Hadrathus</a>,
          <a class="tile" href="/tiles/73">Zelata</a> and
          <a class="tile" href="/tiles/52">Ageera</a> at the beginning of the
          scenario) may perform a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 2
          (Hadrathus, Zelata and Ageera are taken into account for Hindering) to
          deliver the Sorcerer from <a class="tile" href="/tiles/53">Akivasha’s</a>
          hypnosis. When a Sorcerer is freed from Akivasha’s domination, the hero
          who performed the complex Manipulation takes the tile corresponding to
          the Sorcerer from the Overlord’s River as well as the Spell card linked
          to that Sorcerer and places them next to their hero’s sheet. From that
          moment, that Sorcerer is considered an Ally Sorcerer of the heroes and
          is controlled by the hero who just freed them. The Life Point marker of
          the freed Ally Sorcerer remains in the same position on the turn track.</p>

        <p style="clear: both;"><span class="special_title">Ally:</span>
          For this scenario, when a hero activates an Ally Sorcerer, that hero may
          move one gem from their Reserve Zone to the Spell card linked to that
          Sorcerer to cast that spell, without taking into account the cost of the
          Spell and its exertion limit. This is the only way an Ally Sorcerer can
          cast a spell. Each Spell can only be cast once per Ally Sorcerer’s activation
          and each Ally Sorcerer can only be activated once per Heroes’ turn.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Domination:</span>
          Akivasha imposes her domination over an Ally Sorcerer of the heroes.
          The Overlord chooses one of the Sorcerers (Hadrathus, Zelata or Ageera)
          in the line of sight of Akivasha,
          takes that Ally Sorcerer’s tile from the hero and places it in their
          River at the position of the Event tile before its activation (the Event
          tile is still moved to the right, at the end of the River). They also
          take the Spell card linked to that Ally Sorcerer and places it next to
          the Book of Skelos. The Life Point marker of the Sorcerer remains in
          the same position on the turn track and the Sorcerer is now considered
          a Unit of the Overlord.</p>

        <p style="clear: both;"><span class="special_title">Explosive Orb:</span>
          The Overlord’s models in the area effect of the

          A character with or without <a class="skill" href="/skills/16">Leap</a>
          or <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a> may move onto the Bar areas
          or a table area by spending 1 extra movement point. These areas provide

        corner of the peaceful Brythunian village. Hidden at the edge of the
        forest by the dense foliage, the man formulates his plan of attack while
        recalling the painful circumstances that have led him so far.</p>
        <p>Having failed to take over his city of origin by force, he was banished
        and forced to flee Hyperborea on pain of death. But things could not stop
        there. Highly skilled in necromancy and dark magic, he is determined to use
        his terrifying powers to take his revenge. However he now needs an army
        because the golem, which he has recently crafted during a macabre ritual,
        is not enough to march against his former city. So it is the corpses of
        the inhabitants of this country that will provide him with a material of
        top quality.</p>
        <p>Under the cover of nightfall, the Hyperborean sorcerer and his golem
        swoop down on the inn, the first building on the edge of the village.
        Faced with these defenseless villagers, the task of the renegade promises
        to be easy, and he will soon be able to raise his army of undead.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he hasn’t taken Conan into account, the taciturn and
        dangerous Cimmerian who stays here. Who, having become a general in the
        Aquilonian army, has been sent on mission to Brythunia accompanied by a
        squadron of the Black Legion.</p>",

        replaces it. The laid down skeleton models do not count for hindering
        and occupied areas.</p>

        The Overlord then places 15 skeleton models next to the board. When a skeleton
        is killed, the Overlord lays the skeleton down in its area rather than removing
        it from the board. The laid down skeleton models do not count for hindering and
        occupied areas.</p>

        The Hyperborean Primitive can only be wounded by a hero carrying the Stygian Artifact.

        When the Overlord activates the <a class="tile" href="/tiles/1">Event</a>
        tile and resolves the Gaining Ground event, they resolve each of the
        following events in order:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>The Overlord moves 2 gems from their Additional Gem Reserve to their
        Fatigue zone. If there are not enough gems in the Additional gem reserve,
        the Overlord does not move any gems to their Fatigue zone. The gems used
        to dredge the river are removed from the game and cannot be returned to the
        game with this event.</li><br />
          <li>The Recovery value of the Overlord is increased. If the Overlord’s
        Recovery value is “3”, they place the Recovery Value tile with a value of
        “5” on the Book of Skelos. If the Overlord’s Recovery value is “5”, they
        place the Recovery Value tile with a value of “7” on the Book of Skelos.
        If the Overlord’s Recovery value is “7”, the Recovery Value tile is not
        changed.</li><br />
          <li>A tile is chosen by the Overlord from the tiles put aside during setup
        and it is added to the end of the River. The Overlord cannot add a tile to
        the River if all the tiles set aside have already been added. The Overlord
        can add a unit tile to the River if there is at least one model on the board
        (laid down or standing) that corresponds to this tile.
        <br /><br />
        The tiles removed from the River when the Overlord dredges the river are
        removed from the game and cannot be returned to the game with this event.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><span class="special_title">Reinforcement:</span>
        The Overlord can only reinforce units whose tiles are in the River. When
        the Overlord uses a reinforcement point, they stood up one of the laid
        down models on the board. If a laid down model is in an occupied area,
        the Overlord cannot reinforce it.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Pictish Drink:</span>

      description: "<p>Khauran is a small country, wedged between the great
        Western states and the sultanates of the Far East. Its major city—also
        called Khauran—is an affluent trade center that controls many caravan
        routes. Like a watchtower, it stands near the river that separates the
        lush regions from the vast, sandy desert.</p>
        <p>Threatened for decades by the Shemite nomads and the Zuagir pillagers
        who prowl the deserts to the East, the kingdom has always relied on
        contingents of mercenaries from all Hyborian nations to defend itself.
        Though not of Hyborian blood, Conan—the mighty Cimmerian—finds himself
        among those troops after having pledged his sword for gold. A fitting duty
        for the barbarian; clashing swords with Shemites by day, and squandering
        his pay on wine and soft flesh in the taverns of Khauran by night.</p>
        <p>During a night of carousing, Conan overhears a whispered conversation
        regarding a conspiracy against Queen Taramis. He learns that the Captain
        of the Royal Guard could be leading the conspirators with the support of
        the King of Zamora. The Cimmerian knows that the queen rewards loyalty,
        but he also knows that without solid evidence, it will be impossible for
        him to thwart the conspiracy officially. Thus, he decides to act directly
        and, with the help of a few acolytes, heads toward the inn where the
        conspirators are expected to meet, convinced that he will find evidence
        of their treachery.</p>",

      description: "<p>The rumor was true. The Pict warriors of the Eagle Clan
        have succeeded in capturing a dragon; one of the terrible primitive
        creatures that still haunt the immense and ancient forests that border
        the western coast of the Thurian continent.</p>
        <p>Though taming such a monster is unthinkable, even for the Picts, Conan
        is not unaware that some shamans are also priests of Jhebbal Sag, the Lord
        of the Beasts. This cult dates back to a time when men and beasts spoke the
        same language and has been long-forgotten by most. Today only the strongest
        and smartest animals still remember it.</p>
        <p>That is why Conan and a handful of seasoned fighters have made their way
        to the edge of the village of the Eagle Clan to put an end to the threat
        that this monster poses to the Bossonian Marches. Those who remember Jhebbal
        Sag are bound together and can be controlled by one who knows the language
        of the animals.</p>
        <p>With such a weapon in their hands the Picts will not resist the urge to
        use it against their powerful neighbors in Aquilonia for long. It is a risk
        that Conan, commander of the Marches, is not ready to take. He knows the
        Pict ways well and he also knows that it is impossible to surprise them
        with a vast contingent; the Cimmerian has chosen to form a small squadron
        of elite who are reckless enough to face the wild beast and the painted
        warriors on their own territory.</p>",

        Dragons. A hero with the Pictish
        Fetish in the same area as the Dragon can burn the Pictish Fetish by
        performing a simple Manipulation and confuse the Dragon. When the Dragon
        is confused, the Overlord immediately places the Dragon tile at the end

        The <a class="item" href="/items/48">Elixir</a> has been used by

        apply the Elixir on one of their weapons with a simple Manipulation. If
        a hero applies the Elixir on a weapon, the Elixir card is placed under
        the weapon card and the weapon is considered as being poisoned.
        If a hero inflicts at least one wound on the Dragon when using a poisoned
        weapon a <img src="/assets/tokens/numBackToken.png" class="scen_token" />
        token is placed by the Overlord on the Dragon tile that has been set
        aside during setup. The Elixir card is then removed from the game; the
        weapon is no longer considered as being poisoned. If the Dragon
        has not been wounded during the attack then nothing happens and the
        Elixir card remains with the weapon. There cannot be more than 3

      to supply the Zamorian brothels or the Turanian seraglios with the young
      women he succeeds in abducting.</p>
      <p>Pelias knows that unfortunately he cannot solicit the King’s help in this
      matter, for the monarch is a miser in terms of men and money and as such
      he has some consideration for Constantius who executes all his dirty works
      at the cheapest price possible. This is why the magician has decided to act
      by himself, to both help his faithful defender in finding his sweetheart
      and punish the human being trafficker.</p>
      As the group arrives at the gates of the citadel, he is tackled by a large
      gray ape, obviously trained by Constantius, who uses its superhuman strength
      to throw kegs filled with pitch at them. </p>",

        <img src="/assets/tokens/kegToken.png" class="scen_token" /> to throw
        the keg in an area in the Gray Man-Ape’s line of sight. The Overlord
        follows the same rules for throwing an object as the heroes and rolls
        the Melee attack Value of the Gray Man-Ape to determine the distance of
        the throwing. The keg of pitch immediately explodes in the area it is
        thrown in.<br />
        If a model of the Overlord is in the same area as a Keg of Pitch token,
        the Overlord may choose to replace the model’s Melee attack so that the

        The usual defenses against the area attacks may be used. The Keg of Pitch
        token is then removed from play.<br />
        A hero in a keg of pitch’s area may perform a simple manipulation to pick
        it up and transport it; the hero places the Keg of Pitch’s token on their
        hero’s sheet. A keg of pitch has an encumbrance of 6. If a hero suffers
        a wound while carrying a keg of pitch, they immediately put it down in

        <span class="special_title">Gitara:</span>
          During setup, the Overlord places Gitara’s tile next to the board. As
          long as Gitara’s door remains closed, Gitara cannot be attacked nor be wounded.<br />
          As soon as the door is removed from the board, the heroes take the
          Gitara tile who becomes an ally of the heroes and may be activated once
          per Heroes’ turn. A hero with Leadership can activate Gitara by moving
          one gem from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone. Similarly, they
          may purchase additional Movement points for Gitara by moving gems from
          their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone.<br />
          A hero in Gitara’s area gains the Bodyguard skill. Only heroes with
          <a class="skill" href="/skills/31">Bodyguard</a> can spend gems to defend
          Gitara by using that skill.</p>

          or <img src="/assets/tokens/num2Token.png" class="scen_token" />,
          they remove the corresponding token and replaces it with a Portcullis
          token <img src="/assets/tokens/redDoorToken.png" class="scen_sq_token" />.
          The portcullis is now considered lowered. The Overlord can no longer
          bring back reinforcements in that area and the heroes can no longer
          flee from that area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Destroying a Portcullis:</span>

          and carrying a keg of pitch may perform a complex Manipulation with a
          difficulty of 3 to destroy the portcullis and remove that Portcullis
          token from the board. The explosion of the keg does not cause any damage
          to the models in that area and the Pitch of Keg token is discarded.
          The heroes can now flee from that area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Fleeing the Citadel:</span>
          A hero or an ally model can flee the citadel from one of the outer
          areas to the west of the board by spending movement points as though
          the model was moving across a border. The model is then removed from
          the board. Once a model has fled, the model cannot be returned to the
          board. The Units of the Overlord cannot flee from the citadel. A hero
          or an ally model can flee in the same way by one of the areas marked
          by <img src="/assets/tokens/num1Token.png" class="scen_token" /> or
          <img src="/assets/tokens/num2Token.png" class="scen_token" /> tokens

      description: "<p>In the past Zamboula was but a small trading-town, lying
        amidst a ring of oases. It was conquered by the Stygians and they built
        it into a city; the ceaseless caravans crossing the Kharamun desert
        brought it riches. Then Turanian invaders galloped out of the East to
        thrust back the boundaries of Stygia.</p>
        <p>Today, a burning sun glares down with its relentless heat upon the
        exotic streets of the city. For a generation now the noisy and colourful
        Zamboula has been Turan’s westernmost outpost, ruled by the Turanian
        satrap Jungir Khan.</p>
        <p>As he wanders through the streets in the shade of the towers and minarets,
        Conan wipes the sweat away from his eyes. He curses the contract that causes
        him to wear armor in such conditions, but he has little choice because the
        mission is a dangerous one. The Cimmerian mercenary is continuing the quest
        of Pelias the sorcerer, who came to find the Star of Khorala, a jewel of
        inestimable value stolen from the Queen of Ophir.</p>
        <p>The information gathered by the sorcerer has led the small group here
        where they are to meet a certain Jamal. Unfortunately for them, this
        Turanian captain has been imprisoned, having had the bad idea to aggravate
        Totrasmek, the sinister priest of Hanuman who is feared as much by the
        priests of Set as by the Turanians, and it is said that even the Satrap
        avoids him.</p>
        <p>The mercenaries have no choice but to try to get the captain out of the
        citadel where he is being held by Totrasmek’s evil servant, the lethal and
        colossal strangler known as Baal-pteor.</p>",

        When he dies, the key he is carrying falls to the ground, the Overlord
        then places the <a class="item" href="/items/24">Key</a> equipment card
        on the area where <a class="tile" href="/tiles/130">Baal-pteor</a> was.
        A hero can then pick it up by performing a simple Manipulation.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Doors:</span>
        A hero in an area adjacent to a door can perform a complex
        Manipulation with a difficulty of 4 to pick the lock. If the hero succeeds,
        the door is removed from the board. A hero carrying the key can open the
        doors by performing a simple Manipulation. Overlord units can pass doors
        freely. If an Overlord unit passes through a door, the door is removed from
        the board. The doors circled in red are shutters. They follow the same rules
        as doors regarding lock-picking. A model can never move between the two areas
        that a shutter separates, whether it is opened or not. Opening a shutter
        simply creates a line of sight between the two areas it separates.</p>

        <span class="special_title">Bossonian Guards and Captain:</span>
        During setup, the heroes place 2&nbsp;<a class="tile" href="/tiles/17">Bossonian Guards</a>
        models without their colored base and the <a class="tile" href="/tiles/3">Captain</a>
        model as well as their corresponding tiles beside the board. The Overlord
        places the Captain’s life point token
        <img src="https://drabelpdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Conan/tiles/CaptainToken.png" class="scen_token">
        on space 4 of the turn track.</p>

        <p style="clear: both;"><span class="special_title">Cells:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord randomly places the 3 tokens
        <img src="/assets/tokens/numBackToken.png" class="scen_token" />
        numbered 1 to 3 on the board as indicated by the setup diagram. These
        tokens represent the prison cells holding the Captain and the two
        Bossonian Guards. When a hero has
        line of sight to an area containing a Cell token, the hero flips that
        token faceup. If a token numbered 2 or 3 is revealed, the Cell token is
        replaced by a Bossonian Guard model without a colored base. If a token
        with the number 1 is revealed, the Cell token is replaced by the Captain
        model. The Bossonian Guards and Captain models are considered as heroes’
        allies. The heroes can activate them using their Leadership skill.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Fleeing the citadel:</span>
        A hero or an ally can flee the citadel from an area outside
        the citadel to the west of the board indicated by 1 on the diagram, by
        spending movement points as though they were moving across a border. The
        model is then removed from the board. Once a hero or an ally has fled, they
        cannot be returned to the board. The Overlord units cannot flee the citadel.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Leaping From/Climbing a Balcony:</span>
        A character can move across a railing from a balcony area to a ground
        floor area as though it were a border. The character rolls 2 Yellow
        <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" />
        <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> dice
        for falling damage. If the character has
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/16">Leap</a>, the character rolls 1
        Yellow <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> die
        instead. A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a>
        can move across a railing from a ground floor area to a balcony area by
        spending 2 extra movement points.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Pit:</span>
        A character must spend 1 extra movement point to move out of the pit area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Cellar Windows:</span>
        The cellar windows do not block line of sight.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Chests:</span>

      description: "<p>Zingara is a proud and powerful country, bordering the
        great western sea. Yet for many years, even though the country is
        endowed with fertile land, the king and his ancestors before him have
        had their eyes riveted on the rich country of Poitain situated on the
        other side of the river Alimane. This province, owned by Aquilonia, is
        geographically separated from the rest of their kingdom by a chain of
        mountains in the North, whereas only the Alimane  separates it from
        Zingara.</p>
        <p>Although he hesitates in declaring open war, the envious monarch has
        decided to test the defenses and the resistance of the province by
        organizing a raid led by a company of mercenaries. What better than to
        entrust the command to a renegade seeking redemption. Captain Zaporavo,
        a former buccaneer, will make the perfect sacrificial hero without the
        risk of officially incriminating Zingara.</p>
        <p>The objectives given to the mercenaries are twofold, firstly to spread
        confusion, then to get rid of the troops posted at the border of the two
        countries. For this, Zaporavo has recruited formidable wizards and assassins,
        acquaintances met during his buccaneering years. With their help, he
        intends to destroy the main Aquilonian border post and to eradicate the
        garrison occupying the citadel built nearby. A mission more than perilous,
        but one that will assure him fortune and glory.</p>",

      special_rules: '<p><span class="special_title">Two Fronts:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places the two boards next to
        each other. The action in this scenario happens in two distant locations
        and at two different moments in time. The events played on the citadel board
        happen before the action played out on the outpost board.
        The resolution of certain actions on the citadel board will have an impact
        on the actions and units on the outpost board. The two boards are separate
        and are not joined. The models in an area on one board cannot move to an
        area on the other board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Bossonian Guards:</span>
        When the Overlord activates the blue
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/18">Bossonian Guard</a> tile, all the
        Bossonian Guard models with a base (of any color) are activated on both
        game boards. All the Bossonian Guards with a blue and green bases are
        therefore activated. When the Overlord activates the gray Bossonian Guard
        tile, all the Bossonian Guard models without a base on both boards are
        activated.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Reinforcement:</span>
        The Overlord can bring reinforcements into play in any reinforcement
        area, on any board. For example reinforcements can be bought into play
        during the activation of the event tile, on the citadel board and
        on the outpost board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Return of the Braves:</span>
        <a class="hero" href="/heroes/22">Skuthus</a> can only reinforce
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/88">Pirates</a>. He cannot reinforce
        Pict Warriors.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Pict Warriors:</span>
        Only <a class="hero" href="/heroes/25">Zogar Sag</a> can use Leadership
        to activate and defend the
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/87">Pict Warriors</a>.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Pirates:</span>
        Only <a class="hero" href="/heroes/24">Zaporavo</a> can use Leadership
        to activate and defend the <a class="tile" href="/tiles/88">Pirates</a>.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Destroying the outpost:</span>
        The outpost is considered destroyed when the huts numbered
        1 to 6 on the setup diagram are destroyed.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Destroying a hut:</span>
        A hero next to, or inside, a numbered hut area can target it by
        performing a Melee Attack. If the hero obtains at least 6 successes
        during the same attack (4 successes if the maps have been stolen, see
        Stealing the Maps special rule) the hut is destroyed. If an orb is
        exploded in a numbered hut area, the hut is also the target of the area
        attack. An Overlord unit with
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/29">Sacrifice</a>, who is in the same
        area as the hero attacking the hut, can use this skill to protect the
        hut. When a hut is destroyed, the Overlord places a
        <img src="/assets/tokens/rocksToken.png" class="scen_token" />
        token on the hut area. If a chest is in same area as a destroyed hut the
        Overlord removes the chest token from the game. If a model is in the
        same area as a destroyed hut they suffer an attack of 2 Red
        <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" />
        <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> dice
        with no possible reroll (all defenses are possible).</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Destroyed Hut:</span>
        An area with a destroyed hut completely blocks the lines of sight that
        cross it. To enter an area with a destroyed hut costs an additional
        movement point, with or without <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a>.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Sabotaging the Citadel:</span>
        During setup the Overlord places the tokens numbered 1 to 3 on the
        citadel board as shown on the setup diagram. The citadel is considered
        sabotaged if the weapons are destroyed, the supplies are poisoned and
        the outpost maps are stolen.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Destroying the Weapons:</span>
        A hero in the same area as the <img src="/assets/tokens/num1Token.png" class="scen_token" />
        token can perform a Melee Attack to destroy the weapons. It is not
        possible for the Overlord units to use
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/29">Sacrifice</a>Sacrifice to protect
        the weapons. If the hero obtains at least 4 successes during the same
        attack, the weapons are destroyed. The
        <img src="/assets/tokens/num1Token.png" class="scen_token" />
        token is then removed from the game. When the weapons are destroyed, and
        for the rest of the game, the Melee Attack value of the Bossonian Guards
        on the outpost board is reduced to 1 Orange
        <img src="/assets/dice/Orange.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> die.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Poisoning the Supplies:</span>
        A hero with the Elixir equipment card and in the same area as the
        <img src="/assets/tokens/num2Token.png" class="scen_token" /> token
        can poison the supplies by performing a simple Manipulation. The
        Elixir card and the <img src="/assets/tokens/num2Token.png" class="scen_token" />
        token are then removed from the game. When the supplies are poisoned,
        and for the rest of the game, the Armor value of the Bossonian Guards on
        the outpost board is reduced to 1.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Stealing the Maps:</span>
        During setup the Overlord places the
        <a class="item" href="/items/28">Spellbook</a> equipment card next to
        the citadel board. A hero in the same area as the
        <img src="/assets/tokens/num3Token.png" class="scen_token" /> token can
        steal the maps by performing a complex Manipulation with a difficulty
        of 3. If the hero succeeds, they take the Spellbook card and the
        <img src="/assets/tokens/num3Token.png" class="scen_token" /> token
        is removed from the game. The maps are considered as stolen after
        a hero with the Spellbook card has fled the citadel. As soon as the maps
        are stolen, and for the rest of the game, the number of necessary
        successes to destroy a hut is reduced to 4.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Fleeing the citadel:</span>
        A hero can flee the citadel from an area outside the citadel to the west
        of the board, or from one of the citadel entrance areas to the north and
        south of the board, by spending movement points as though the hero were
        moving across a border and removing the hero’s model from the board.
        Once a hero has fled, the hero’s model cannot be returned to the board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Pictish Drink:</span>
        A hero may discard this <a class="item" href="/items/45">item</a> to
        move 2 gems from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone but must also
        suffer 1 wound.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Leaping From/Climbing a Balcony:</span>
        A character can move across a railing from a balcony area to a ground
        floor area as though it were a border. The character rolls 2 Yellow
        <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" />
        <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> dice
        for falling damage. If the character has
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/16">Leap</a>, the character rolls 1
        Yellow <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> die
        instead. A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a>
        can move across a railing from a ground floor area to a balcony area by
        spending 2 extra movement points.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Pit:</span>
        A character must spend 1 extra movement point to move out of the pit area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Hut Flaps:</span>
        A character must spend 1 extra movement point to move across a border
        into or out of a hut. Moving across an opening token does not cost an
        extra movement point.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Climbing:</span>
        A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a> can move
        across boulders <img src="/assets/tokens/rocksToken.png" class="scen_token" />
        as though they were a border by spending 2 extra movement points.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Wooden Huts:</span>

      description: "<p>Bahram, the influential warlock in the service of the
        Sultan of Iranistan, has lost control of his powers. He has become a
        shape-shifter against his own will and no one knows whether this is a
        punishment from the gods or a curse picked up from his excessive studies
        of impious mysteries. As the evil continues to worsen, and in fear of
        losing his human envelope once and for all, the warlock has started a
        complex and dangerous ritual in order to lift this curse. The Sultan, on
        the other hand, does not wish to run any risks and has sent Prince Kerim
        Shah to solve the problem at his discretion; Bahram has become a danger
        to the ruling family and the people around him.</p>
        <p>Kerim Shah is unwilling to send his best warriors to certain death so
        he buys the services of a band of killers in the streets of the cosmopolitan
        and colorful Zambula, in Turanian territory. Killers that, provided they
        are highly paid, have little regard for the dangers that may be incurred;
        a renegade from the Black Kingdoms - a taciturn barbarian from the north,
        and a Shemite warrior whose beauty is as dark as her blade is deadly.</p>
        <p>Their orders are simple, find Bahram and eliminate him. However, in the
        face of the warlock’s power, the Sultan will be satisfied if the group
        succeeds, at the very least, in preventing his ritual thus leaving him to
        end his days in the form of an animal.</p>",

        animal form tiles. The models of the Giant Spider, the Giant Scorpion and
        the Camel are placed next to the Book of Skelos, these models are considered
        as being the animal form models.</p>
        <p style="clear: both;"><img src="https://drabelpdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Conan/tiles/PiratesOrangeAlt.jpg" class="scen_event float_tile">
        <span class="special_title">Pirate:</span>
        During setup the Overlord places the
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/89">Pirate</a> tile (orange, armor value 2
        and movement value 2) next to the Book of Skelos.
        Pirates are considered neither as being heroes’ allies nor Overlord units;
        they do not count for hindering for either side. Pirates can only
        be killed by a melee attack performed by the Overlord troops. They do
        not suffer damage from wounds inflicted by heroes.</p>

        <p style="clear: both;"><span class="special_title">Curse:</span>
        If at least one of the animal form tiles is placed unbloody
        side faceup at the beginning of each activation of the
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/72">Warlock</a> tile, the
        Overlord carries out the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Overlord chooses one of the animal form tiles unbloody side faceup
        and turns it bloody side faceup.</li><br />
          <li>The model representing the Warlock is then replaced by the animal
        form model corresponding to the animal form tile that has just been turned
        bloody side faceup. This model now represents the Warlock. The Warlock’s
        turn will be played in the current animal form.</li><br />
          <li>While the Warlock is represented by an animal form model, all the
        characteristics of the animal form tile (movement, armor, attack and skills)
        corresponding to the animal form model that represents the Warlock, replace
        all the characteristics of the Warlock tile (movement, armor, attack, spells
        and skills). If Mitra’s Halo is activated when the Warlock is transformed,
        it is automatically deactivated.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If all the animal form tiles are placed bloody side faceup at the
        beginning of each activation of the Warlock tile, the Overlord carries
        out the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The Overlord turns all the animal form tiles unbloody side faceup.</li><br />
          <li>The model that represents the Warlock is replaced by the model
        of the Warlock. The Warlock’s turn is then played in the form of the Warlock.</li><br />
          <li>While the Warlock is represented by the model of the Warlock,
        the characteristics of the Warlock tile (movement, armor, attack, spells
        and skills) are used for all that concerns the Warlock.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><span class="special_title">Warding off the curse:</span>
        To ward off the curse the Overlord must sacrifice a Pirate
        on each of the three altars. For this the pirate must be in the same area
        as an altar token <img src="/assets/tokens/num1Token.png" class="scen_token" />
        and the Overlord must kill them using a melee attack. When a pirate is
        sacrificed on an altar, the altar token is removed from the board as well
        as the animal tile and model corresponding to the altar token
        (1-Camel, 2-Giant Scorpion, 3-Giant Spider). If the animal
          form model that must be removed from the game corresponds to the
          current form of the Warlock, it
          is then replaced on the board by the model of the Warlock.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Escorting the Pirates:</span>
        If an Overlord unit starts its activation phase in the same
        area as a Pirate, the Overlord can
        decide to move the Pirate model at the same time as the activated unit.
        The Pirate makes the same move (or part of the move) as the Overlord unit.
        If the Overlord uses a Movement benefit for the activated unit, the Pirate
        can follow the unit without the Overlord moving an additional gem for the
        pirate’s move. At any moment of the unit’s move, the Overlord can decide
        that the Pirate will no longer follow the unit in question and so stop the
        Pirate. It must not be forgotten that Pirates do not count for hindering.
        An Overlord model can only move one Pirate with them and each Pirate can
        only be moved once per tile activation.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Attacking the Warlock:</span>
        When the Warlock is represented by
        an animal form model the heroes cannot target it with an attack (Melee
        or Ranged).</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Altar:</span>
        A hero in the same area as an altar can perform a simple Manipulation
        to activate the altar. If a hero activates the altar corresponding
        to the current form of the Warlock (1-Camel, 2-Giant Scorpion,
        3-Giant Spider) then the animal form model is replaced by that of the Warlock.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Lines of Sight:</span>
        A character in a wall area has line of sight to each ground
        area within the fortress walls. An area in a tower and an area outside
        that tower are within each other’s line of sight only if the areas are
        in or adjacent to the tower.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Leaping from Walls:</span>
        A character can move across a parapet from a wall area to
        a ground area as though it were a border. The character rolls 2 Red
        <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" />
        <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> dice for
        falling damage. If the character has
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/16">Leap</a>, the character rolls 1 Red
        <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> die instead.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Rock Slides:</span>
        A character can move into a rock slide area
        <img src="/assets/tokens/rocksToken.png" class="scen_token" /> from an
        adjacent area. The character must spend 2 extra movement points unless
        the character has <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a>.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Chests:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places 4 chests on the board
        as indicated by the setup diagram. The asset deck contains:

      description: "<p>Under the low ceiling, blackened by the smoke of a sordid
      dive engulfed in the tortuous alleys of Peshkhauri, the atmosphere suddenly
      strains. The dark, inscrutable face of the Cimmerian colossus, with an air
      as untamed as redoubtable, turns into a ferocious rictus. Surrounded by
      Turanian bandits, he addresses a man standing on the balcony overlooking
      the room: “We have fulfilled our part of the deal and braved the Kshatriyas
      warriors in order to seize these treasure chests crucial for your intrigues
      in Vendhya. So, by Crom, either you pay what you owe us or we shall take our
      due!”</p>
      <p>“Take your due?” sneers the lord of Conan and of his redoubtable comrades
      in arms. “I have provided you with the help of this Ne- median thief standing
      by my side, so I believe it necessary that you revise your price downwards,
      for without him you would not have succeeded. Or maybe would you rather
      discuss with my masters, the Black Prophets?”</p>
      <p>The man then turns around and walks away barking: “Throw these tramps
      out, they do not deserve the price for their services”. At these words, the
      Turanian closest to Conan spits at his feet, but reacting swiftly, the
      barbarian punches him in the face and breaks his jaw; true to his former
      reputation as Iron Hand. Then the tavern soon resounds with the clatter
      of knocked-over benches, trampling, screams and curse words in a furious fray</p>",

          Heroes have no equipment in this scenario. However, they ignore penalties
          from unarmed attacks. If a hero’s life points are reduced to zero, they
          are considered “out of combat” and their model is laid down in their area
          of the board. They are not considered dead (therefore, the number of gems
          that their companions recover do not change) and they will have to declare
          themselves Cautious during the next Heroes’ Stance Phase.<br />
          If a <a class="tile" href="/tiles/19">Bossonian Guard</a> or a
          <a class="tile" href="/tiles/33">Pirate</a> has their life points
          reduced to zero, they are not dead and their model is laid down in
          their area. If all the models of a tile are laid down, the Overlord
          flips the tile over to its « bloodied » face then places it to the
          right, at the end of their River.<br />
          When <a class="tile" href="/tiles/63">Khemsa</a> or
          <a class="tile" href="/tiles/70">Taurus</a> have their life points
          reduced to zero, they are removed from the game and their tile is
          flipped over to its “bloodied” face, then placed to the right, at the
          end of their River.<br />
          A laid down model is not taken into account for Hindering and Occupied
          areas.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Dredging the River:</span>
          If the Overlord removes the Pirate or Bossonian Guard tiles when
          dredging the River, they must then remove from the board all the laid
          down models corresponding to the removed tile.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Recovery of the heroes:</span>
          When a hero declares themselves Cautious during the Heroes’ Stance phase,
          they may choose to either move 5 gems from their Fatigue zone to their
          Reserve zone or move all their gems from their Wound zone to their Fatigue
          zone.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Treasure Chests:</span>
          During setup, the Overlord places 2 Treasure Chest tokens
          <img src="/assets/tokens/numBackToken.png" class="scen_token" /> as
          indicated in the setup diagram. The Treasure Chest token is considered
          an object with an encumbrance of 10. A hero in a Treasure Chest token’s
          area may perform a simple Manipulation to pick it up. A hero carrying
          a treasure chest cannot perform a Melee Attack.<br />
          If a hero carrying a treasure chest is the target of the Inversion
          spell, they drop the treasure chest in their area, then the Inversion
          spell is resolved.<br />
          If a hero carrying the treasure chest is “out of combat”, they drop the
          treasure chest in their area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Alcohol Cask:</span>
          A hero in an Alcohol Cask token’s area may perform a simple Manipulation
          to take the Alcohol Cask token
          <img src="/assets/tokens/kegToken.png" class="scen_token" />
          from the board and place it on their Hero’s sheet. The hero then moves
          2 gems from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone (in priority move
          the gems from the Fatigue zone, then the ones from the Action spaces
          if the Fatigue zone is empty).</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Hangover:</span>
          The Overlord may remove an Alcohol Cask token from a hero’s sheet to
          force that hero to Reroll right after the free Rerolls and before any
          Reroll actions.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Walls:</span>
          A character with <a class="skill" href="/skills/11">Wall Wrecker</a>
          cannot use it to move across an outer wall of the inn or to move
          between areas of different elevations.<br />

          A character can move across a railing from a balcony area to a ground

          can move across a railing from a ground floor area to a balcony area by
          spending 2 extra movement points.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Leaping From/Climbing a Stairwell:</span>
          A character can move across a banister from a stair area to a ground
          floor area as though it were a border. The character rolls 2 Yellow
          <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" />
          <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> dice
          for falling damage. If the character has

          spending 1 extra movement point.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Bar:</span>
          A character with or without <a class="skill" href="/skills/16">Leap</a>
          or <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a> may move onto the Bar areas
          or a table area by spending 1 extra movement point. These areas provide
          an Elevation bonus of 1 Yellow
          <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> die. A
          character in the bar’s area or in a table’s area, with or without
          Reach, may attack a character in an adjacent area with a Melee Attack.
          These areas do not block line of sight. A character may exit these
            areas with no movement penalty.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Bar Stools:</span>
          A character in a chair token’s area may pick it up for free when performing
          a Melee Attack. The chair token is immediately returned to the box and
          that character benefits from the chair’s attack bonus of 1 Yellow
          <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> die

      description: "<p>Night has fallen on Messantia when Conan sets foot in the
      streets overlooking the seafront of Argos’ opulent capital. This commercial
      and cosmopolitan maritime city will be a good starting point for gleaning
      information. Ships from every nation moor in its harbor, and the laws there
      are lenient. The city owes its wealth to licit and illicit activities, many
      buccaneers and smugglers come to deal discreetly with local merchants.</p>
      <p>Conan knows the city well; he has been here many times when he was a
      pirate from the Barachan Isles. Leading his group on the quays, the Cimmerian
      is looking for the merchant Publio. This Argosian, with whom Conan has often
      dealt in the past, is always aware of everything that happens in Messantia
      and he has no problem in dealing with, even the most detestable, bandits.</p>
      <p>Publio can usually be found as the Silver Swordfish tavern, a cheap
      eating-house that also serves as his office. When the Cimmerian and his
      companions cross the front door, they come across an unexpected sight. The
      establishment is full of watch soldiers. Publio is there as expected, but
      on his knees before a captain who shouts at the newcomers, waving the weapons
      in his hands, “This tavern is closed! Leave right now you scum, it is time
      for Publio to answer to his trafficking with the enemies of Argos.”</p>",

      his companions finally land in Kordava, the capital of the kingdom of Zingara
      and listed among the most sumptuous ports of the western nations.</p>
      <p>After paying a rather hefty sum, the Cimmerian has obtained permission from
      the city’s Provost Marshal to visit Arvad, who is being held in prison for
      theft and smuggling. Once behind the massive walls that separates the prison
      from the rest of the city, the mercenaries must leave their weapons at the

        understands that Flavia’s abductor used the services of an accomplice who
        is not identified in the letter, but that the latter should go to the coastal
        territory of the Picts in order to successfully proceed in the exchange of
        arms, jewels, and wine for skins, copper, and gold dust.</p
        <p>Without further delay, the mercenaries embark on the first ship leaving
        for Zingara, deciding to then rejoin the Pictish territory by way of the
        mainland. Conan knows that this is a dangerous journey; the wild and
        desolate west coast stretches for a thousand miles and is only populated
        by coastal villages of ferocious tribes.</p>
        <p>After having disembarked at Kordava, the sumptuous capital of Zingara,
        and having made an exhausting journey of several days through the Pictish
        Wilderness; Conan and his men finally arrive at the edge of the village
        indicated in the letter. A few hours of careful surveillance enable them
        to see that several foreigners are lodging there with the painted devils;
        a Kushite sorcerer, a Kothian warrior and a Turanian prince.</p>
        <p>It is now necessary to enter the village in order to unmask the

      description: "<p>Making the most of the advance paid by Count Alberico, Conan
        soon charters a ship and sets up a crew to rejoin Khemi, the largest port
        of Stygia, in order to find Noliades.</p>
        <p>Having plundered the coast when he was a pirate, he knows it well and
        the Cimmerian chooses to anchor the ship in a small bay downstream of the
        mouth of the Styx and the black walls of the city. According to Publio’s
        information, the plunderer must go to the lost tomb of Skuthus, a former
        high priest of the snake-god Set.</p>
        <p>After several hours of extremely demanding progress in infernal heat
        through a marshy area overgrown with mangroves and lianas, and infested with
        snakes and crocodiles, the mercenaries come across the ruin of an ancient
        mausoleum concealed beneath the luxuriant vegetation. Scarcely have they
        crossed the entrance of the edifice when a feverish-looking Stygian comes
        out to meet them, “What are you doing here? No one knows the existence of
        this place!”</p>
        <p>An icy flash passes through the azure eyes of the Cimmerian, “Your
        appearance is certainly deceptive Noliades, but your accent remains that
        of a Zamorian. We are not here for the treasures that you seek, but on the
        traces of the crook who took the daughter of Count Alberico. Speak and we
        will leave the premises here and now!”</p>
        <p>As the Zamorian prepares to speak, the ground suddenly starts to vibrate
        and a demonic laugh coming from the depths of the earth invades the devastated
        mausoleum. The soul of Skuthus is still linked to his tomb, ready to punish
        violators. A skeletal hand emerges from the ground to grab Conan’s ankle...</p>",

        boozers in the inns and to the merchants he meets on the way.</p>
        <p>The mercenaries finally catch up with the Kothian bandit shortly after
        the mountainous foothills of the kingdom of Corinth, which naturally delimit
        the border with Zamora. Constantius and his men are staying in an inn and
        so it is quite natural that Conan and his companions decided to stay there
        as mere travelers.</p>
        <p>After an investigation as rapid as it is discreet, the Cimmerian finds no
        trace of Flavia; but it would seem that the Kothian does not only enrich himself
        with kidnapping princesses. A dark and terrifying aberration of nature, smelling
        of sulfur and smoke, is chained in the cellar of the establishment. It is
        obviously drugged with Black Lotus to keep it quiet before being sold to some
        evil sorcerer.</p>

        pursuers, but they have sunk deep into Pictish territory, into the wild
        virgin lands far removed from civilization.</p>
        <p>Conan’s instinct and his unrivalled tracking skills have saved the group
        of fighters, but all need to find a refuge to heal their wounds and rest.
        In front of them, the vegetation suddenly becomes scarcer and Conan sees
        the outlines of wooden constructions. On the alert and in a tense silence,
        the barbarian approaches to discover a dilapidated and abandoned lakeside
        village on stilts.</p>
        <p>The warriors choose to settle in a still-intact hut, and as Conan inspects
        the rest of the village, he comes face to face with a terrifying ghostly
        apparition. Throwing his weapon in a prodigious reflex, he touches the phantom
        that screams and turns out to be a gaunt paint-covered Pict. Not Sure that he
        is alone, the Cimmerian does not chase after him and hurries back to his men
        in order to prepare for the worst.</p>
        <p>And the worst is to come, this shaman, living the life of a recluse, is
        completely mad and highly skilled in the darkest of magical arts.</p>",

        group reach the coastal village mentioned by Constantius. They note, not
        without bitterness, that the Picts have moved on, presumably in a hurry
        to share the fruits of their exchanges with allied tribes.</p>
        <p>The mercenaries throw themselves into a frantic chase upon the trail of
        these small dark-skinned men with muscular chests and arms, clad only in
        suede loincloths with feathers stuck in their black mane of hair. Fortunately
        for Conan, the progress of the Picts is greatly slowed by the weight of the
        objects they carry, overloaded with trunks and chests to be carried without
        carts through the dense and untamed forest.</p>
        <p>The convoy is quickly caught up as it passes through a small ancient
        village perched on stilts. One of the chests immediately attracts the
        attention of the Cimmerian giant, because it is particularly voluminous and
        manipulated very carefully by the painted warriors. It can only be the chest
        Constantius described.</p>
        <p>Just as the mercenaries rush in to attack, a tall stranger with a thin,
        pale body arrives at the village. He seems expected, but to the surprise of
        Conan, his appearance brings to mind a Hyperborean sorcerer. It is now too
        late to think about why he might have left his distant snow-covered lands to
        meet the Picts, for it is necessary to seize the chest.</p>",

      description: "<p>Few people can boast of having crossed the path of the fierce
      Pict warriors and of still being alive. However, the savage tribes along the
      coast are not averse to bartering with the representatives of civilized nations
      who dare venture so far.</p>
        <p>Conan, concealed beneath the thick vegetation on top of a cliff, observes
        the tribal village below. There, the Picts are busy sorting out and storing
        many objects and equipment from all over the continent; Steel weapons, finery
        and embroidered fabrics as well as the wine of which they are particularly
        fond.</p>
        <p>The presence of a stranger attracts the attention of the Cimmerian. A man
        with a thin body and strong bone structure, his pale complexion and reserved
        air as well as his getup leave little room for doubt; he is a sorcerer from
        Hyperborea. One of the chests seems to be the center of his attention while
        he performs a strange ritual.</p>
        <p>The contents of the chest must be of inestimable value to be subjected to
        what Conan interprets as a powerful magical protection spell. The formidable
        warrior, determined to find out, establishes a quick plan of attack to get
        his hands on its contents.</p>
        <p>However, while an average person could never detect the presence of Conan’s
        group, a life spent in one of the wildest territories of this world has sharpened
        the eyes and senses of these men covered with hideous paintings.</p>",

        in the huts as indicated by the setup diagram.<br />
        The Overlord then takes the numbered Orb cards and secretly selects one
        card of each color with a different number on each card. The Overlord ends
        up with 3 Orb cards with different colors and numbers. These 3 cards indicate
        the receptacle on which the heroes must place the corresponding orbs to
        prevent the destruction of the mysterious chest. The selected cards are
        placed facedown near the Overlord. The remaining six Orb cards are shuffled
        and form the Orb card deck.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Special Equipment deck:</span>
        During setup the Overlord creates and shuffles the Special Equipment deck.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Opening the mysterious chest:</span>
        Picking up and dropping an orb is a simple Manipulation. When an orb is
        dropped in the same area as receptacle, the Overlord indicates whether the
        orb is correctly placed or not. An orb is correctly placed if the color of
        the orb and the number of the receptacle corresponds to the color of the orb
        and the number written on one of the Orb cards set aside by the Overlord
        during setup.<br />
        If it is, the Overlord flips faceup the corresponding Orb card. Then the
        hero who placed the orb draws a card from the Special Equipment deck. When
        the three orbs have been correctly placed, the mysterious chest opens and
        the hero who placed the last orb draws an additional card from the Special
        Equipment deck. So that hero will draw two cards from the Special Equipment
        deck when placing the third orb correctly.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Chests:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places 6 chests on the board as indicated by
        the setup diagram. Each time a hero opens a chest, that chest token is
        discarded and that hero draws a card from the Orb deck. This helps the heroes
        to eliminate the wrong combinations of orbs and receptacles.<p>',

      to Stygia. Conan now knows where to look for the magic dagger because he knows
      the sea of Vilayet well from his years spent as a buccaneer. His idea is to
      travel to Stygia then sail up the River Styx, and ride across to the shores
      of the inland sea and the Yuetshi region. Yet the morose Cimmerian warrior
      wonders, for as he remembers, there was nothing else on the island of Xapur
      but old forgotten ruins.
      </p>
        <p>On the third day of navigation, the look-out shouts a cry of alarm. A brig,
        flying the black flag, has taken chase. As Conan deploys full sail in a bid to
        escape, a whirlpool forms under the ship, and they are soon hindered by a
        colossal form. Horrifying tentacles emerge from the waves and whip against
        the deck, while a gigantic mass from the dawn of time looms from the water.
        Conan and his companions prepare to face the indescribable creature when the
        enemy approaches.</p>
        <p>In the middle of the shouting pirates all waving their cutlasses stands
        a man who seems to have nothing in common with the rest of the crew. He is
        dressed in an Oriental fashion and seems to be chanting a sinister incantation.
        Conan quickly understands that the monster’s appearance is the result of black

        <p><span class="special_title">Thaug:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places the Thaug model as indicated by the setup
        diagram, straddling the two areas to the East. These two areas are considered
        occupied. For this scenario Thaug has no life points and cannot be the
        target of an attack. There is no Unit tile for Thaug in the scenario.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Trunk of supplies:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places 3 trunks of supplies as indicated by the
        setup diagram, they are represented by the tokens. A hero in a trunk’s
        area may pick it up by performing a simple Manipulation. The Overlord Units
        cannot pick up trunks. If a hero carrying a trunk falls into the water
        (because of a failed leap, of constriction, because he chose to leap into
        the water, etc.), the trunk remains in the last ship area it was in before
        the hero fell into the water. A trunk has an encumbrance of 5.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Tentacles:</span>
        There can never be more than one Tentacle model per area. If a leap is
        performed over a Tentacle’s area, the difficulty of the leap is increased
        by 1. Overlord units are also affected by this hindering.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Reinforcement:</span>
        During reinforcement the Overlord can choose to reinforce Pirates and
        Tentacles. Pirates are reinforced normally. When reinforcing Tentacles,
        the Overlord places their models on whichever water area they choose, on
        the condition that there is never more than one Tentacle model per area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Leap:</span>
        If a hero’s or Overlord’s model fails to
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/16">Leap</a>, they fall into the water and
        their model is placed on the water area they leaped over. The heroes or
        Overlord units can decide to fall directly into the water; this does not
        cost any extra movement points and does not require any particular skill.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Water Area:</span>
        A model on a water area can still fight without penalty. Characters with
        <a class="skill" href="/skills/13">Swimming</a> can move from one water
        area to the adjacent water for 1 extra movement point. A model (with or
        without <a class="skill" href="/skills/19">Climb</a>)on a water area can
        climb up onto an adjacent ship area for 2 extra movement points. A
        character that does not have <a class="skill" href="/skills/13">Swimming</a>
        cannot move from one water area to another water area, but can climb up
        onto an adjacent ship area by spending an extra 2 movement points with or
        without Climb.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Chests:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places 2 chests on the board
        as indicated by the setup diagram. The asset deck contains:
        1&nbsp;<a class="item" href="/items/17">Leather Armor</a> and

      in Kordava they embark towards Stygia because Conan now knows where to look
      for the magic dagger. He wants to go up the River Styx, and then ride across
        the plains of Shem and the Eastern Desert to reach the sea of Vilayet. Even
        so, there is something bothering the morose Cimmerian warrior. In his memory,
        there was nothing else on the island of Xapur but old, forgotten ruins.</p>
        <p>After a few days of travel, Conan is drawn out of his dark thoughts by
        a ship sailing towards them. The infallible instinct of the barbarian helps
        him predict danger even before the lookout shouts the bad news. It's the
        Vandal, the ship of Zaporavo, the Zingaran renegade. Collision is unavoidable.
        Soon, bodies fall pierced by the arrows raining down. Under the roar of Conan,
        the sailors seize their weapons to courageously face their enemies.</p>
        <p>On the deck of the enemy ship, a seemingly oriental sorcerer chants
        sinister incantations. immediately a whirlpool is formed under the keel of
        Conan’s galleon, and Horrifying tentacles emerge from the waves, while a
        gigantic mass from the dawn of time looms from the water. The situation
        is critical, but the barrels of pitch embarked before departure could make
        the difference.</p>",

      description: "<p>The soldiers of fortune make the long journey to the Turanian
      City of Sultanapur, where Conan still has contacts among the buccaneers who
      plunder the inland sea of the Thurian continent.</p>
        <p>The Cimmerian finds, although not without difficulty, a ship ready to
        take him to the inhospitable region inhabited by the last Yuetshi. There
        he hopes to get his hands on the magic dagger. The captain is frank with
        him; he will not wait for them, because Jehungir Agha, Lord of Khawarism
        and the vassal of the powerful king Yezdigerd of Turan, has launched his
        fleet in a vast pirate hunt.</p>
        <p>After a few days of travel, a strange whirlpool forms under the ship’s
        keel and the galleon is hindered by a colossal form. Horrific tentacles
        spring forth whipping against the deck, bending and cracking the vessel as
        a gigantic mass from the dawn of time looms from the water. Conan and his
        companions prepare to face the indescribable creature when a brig appears
        alongside the mercenaries.</p>
        <p>On the deck of the enemy’s ship, in the midst of the screaming pirates
        brandishing their sabers, stands a man who looks nothing like a sailor. He
        is dressed in an Oriental fashion and shouts out to the Cimmerian barbarian,
        “Contemplate the forces of the invisible kingdoms, for you will soon become
        one with the Abyss and you will grovel at the feet of the Master of Xapur.”</p>",

        There can never be more than one Tentacle model per area. If a leap is

        inhospitable coast facing the island of Xapur. The surroundings are formed
        from a vast swamp covered with reeds and abandoned to ferocious beasts. Only
        a few Yuetshi fishing villages still exist in the region.</p>
        <p>When the Cimmerian approaches the village that harbors the dagger, he
        falls upon a Yuetshi leaning back against the foot of a tree, a gaping
        wound in his side and eyes already glazing over. The fisherman mumbles in
        a trembling voice, “Take care! The devil has bewitched my brothers. He
        sent...”, he then collapses, dead.</p>
        <p>A wild clamor rises from the center of the village. intrigued, Conan
        silently approaches and notes with horror that a sinister character wearing
        the attire of a sorcerer with his hands clasped round a large curved-blade
        dagger, is ranting to the inhabitants, “The Master of Xapur is back. Your
        Master is back, but as he rebuilds Dagonia, his enemies draw closer every
        day and...” The sentence remains suspended in the mouth of the sorcerer,
        who suddenly looks in the direction of the Cimmerian.</p>
        <p>“They're there, attack, attack them! The Master will reward you.”
        immediately the Yuetshi throw themselves on the mercenaries, their haggard
        eyes shining with the aura of madness. Nothing seems to stop them. The
        sorcerer then takes advantage of the scuffle to throw the dagger into the

        <p><span class="special_title">Yuetshi Knife:</span>
        During setup and before the heroes deploy, the Overlord decides where in
        the swamp the knife has been thrown. The Overlord secretly notes on a piece
        of paper the number between 1 and 10 corresponding to the area of the board
        containing the knife. The <a class="item" href="/items/15">Yuetshi knife</a>
        lowers the Armor Value of <a class="tile" href="/tiles/11">Khosatral Khel</a>
        to 3.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Searching the Swamp:</span>
        A hero in a numbered swamp area can search it to find the
        <a class="item" href="/items/15">Yuetshi knife</a> by performing a complex
        Manipulation with a difficulty of 1. If the hero succeeds, the Overlord
        indicates whether it is the area in which the knife is located. If it is,
        the Overlord shows the number written on a piece of paper during setup
        and that hero picks up the Yuetshi Knife card.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Interrogating a Pict:</span>
        When a hero kills a
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/29">Pict Warrior</a>, a
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/85">Pict Archer</a> or a
        <a class="tile" href="/tiles/24">Pict Hunter</a> in a melee attack, they
        can perform a simple Manipulation to interrogate him. The Pict will give
        them information to reduce their search for the knife. The Overlord
        must then remove the number token of his choice that does not match the
        location of the knife. Reinforcement Picts may also be interrogated. If
        there is only one numbered token left, it is no longer possible to
        interrogate a Pict.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Fleeing the Swamp:</span>
        A hero can flee the swamp from one of the areas marked
        <img src="/assets/tokens/area1Token.png" class="scen_token" />
        by spending movement points as though the hero was moving across a border.
        The hero’s model is then removed from the board. Once a hero has fled,
        the hero’s model cannot be returned to the board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Pictish Drink:</span>
        A hero may discard this <a class="item" href="/items/45">item</a>
        to move 2 gems from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone but
        must also suffer 1 wound.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Chests:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places 6 chests on the board
        as indicated by the setup diagram. The asset deck contains:
        2&nbsp;<a class="item" href="/items/22">Life Potions</a>,

        central square, usually busy at this time of day. The mercenaries penetrate
        the village and Conan already has his steel in hand when the first Yuetshi
        runs screaming out. They seem possessed, just as were the fisherman in the
        village where the magic dagger was hidden. While the commotion and cries
        of rage of the warriors are heard all around the village, the Cimmerian
        understands that they were expected and that the same sorcery is at work
        here; this time put into action by a Yuetshi sorcerer in the service of
        Khosatral Khel.</p>

        Opening a chest is a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 1.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Overlord and Opening a Chest:</span>
        The Overlord’s models can attempt to open a chest. An Overlord’s model of
        an activated Unit tile in a chest’s area can roll the dice of their Melee
        attack characteristics to perform a complex Manipulation. Each model of the
        activated Unit tile may perform this action. This action replaces the attack
        action of all of the models of the Unit tile for this activation. If the
        action is successful, the Overlord draws a card from the asset deck. The
        Equipment cards revealed by the Overlord other than the spellbook are
        discarded. If the Spellbook is revealed, then the model which has just
        opened the chest takes the spellbook and carries it with them. To represent
        this, the Spellbook card is placed under the base of that Overlord’s model.
        The Overlord’s models are not affected by the spellbook’s encumbrance.
        </p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Taking back the Spellbook:</span>
        The spellbook can be stolen from the model carrying it if that model suffers
        at least 1 wound. The Spellbook card is then placed in that model’s area.
        A hero in the spellbook’s area may pick it up by performing a simple
        Manipulation. An Overlord’s model of an activated Unit tile in the spellbook’s
        area may pick it up if the Overlord moves 1 gem from their Reserve zone
        to their Fatigue zone.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Spellbook:</span>
        A hero in another hero’s area another hero’s area may give them the spellbook
        by performing a simple Manipulation. An Overlord’s model of an activated Unit
        tile in another Overlord’s model’s area may give them the spellbook if
        the Overlord moves 1 gem from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone.
        The spellbook is fragile and cannot be thrown.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Fleeing the Inn:</span>
        A hero or an Overlord character can flee the inn from one of the outside
        areas to the south of the board by spending movement points as though
        they were moving across a border. Their model is then removed from the
        board. Once they have fled, their model cannot be returned to the board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Pictish Drink:</span>
        A hero may discard this <a class="item" href="/items/45">item</a>
        to move 2 gems from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone but
        must also suffer 1 wound.</p>

        as indicated by the setup diagram. The asset deck contains:

      of the Turanian city of Khawarizm, the mercenaries no longer have the means
      to charter a ship of find a crew. Time is short and faced with the lack of
      other solutions, the Cimmerian suggests to his companions that they carry out
      a raid on one of the palaces of Jehungir Agha, the lord of Khawarizm and
      guardian of the maritime borders.</p>
        <p>Conan had known for a long time that Jehungir keeps some of his most
        precious treasures in a fortress on the edge of the city. When he was a
        Kozak, a good-for-nothing moving in the savage and bare expanses of the
        steppe, the Cimmerian heard of magical objects worth a King’s ransom that
        the provincial governor jealousy protects. There is no doubt that these
        artifacts would soon find takers if they were stolen.</p>
        <p>If Conan has kept his reflexes as a thief, it is not the case of some
          of his companions. Shortly after they had discreetly infiltrated the
          building, one of the mercenaries sets off an alarm, releasing a
          monstrosity with shiny and sinuous rings at the same time. The Cimmerian
          and his companions are also unaware that Jehungir’s artifacts are gorged
          with the darkest and most evil of witchcraft.</p>",

      description: "<p>The muscles of the gnarled and tanned arms of the Cimmerian
      swell as he pulls on the oars to approach the small craft to the shore of
      the island of Xapur.</p>
        <p>Once landed, the men take the steps carved out of rock and quickly
        reach the steep cliffs that dominate over the sea. Once the curtain of
        vegetation has been crossed, they realize that the mysterious ruins that
        give its name to the island have disappeared, yielding their place to a
        large dark green wall sheltering cyclopean buildings and towers rising
        vertiginously toward the sky.</p>
        <p>Dagonia is being resurrected through a strange and incomprehensible
        magic. Thanks to the blood of Flavia, the distant descendant of the last
        Dagonians, Khosatral Khel can completely unleash his power and enslave
        much more that just Xapur!</p>
        <p>The mercenaries rush to the center of the city and see Flavia in a
        critical situation. She lies wounded and bleeding at the feet of the Devil
        in Iron, whose shoulders span is just as monstrous as the impressive muscles
        of his limbs. He is dressed in sandals, a skirt and a large grainy leather
        belt. His square-cut hair is held back by a golden ring while a dark fire
        seems to consume the eyes of a face devoid of weakness and pity.</p>
        <p>The sacrifice has begun, but there is still time to save the Argosian
        princesses and to send the vile being back to the abyss that it should
        never have left. For that, the heroes will need to confront the nightmarish
        shadow that is growing ever bigger in front of them. A terrifying form
        generated from the pits of hell and whose sight could freeze with terror
        even the intrepid Cimmerian.</p>
        <p>At this moment, taken over by an uncontrollable fury, Conan releases all
        the ferocity of the barbarian that he never ceased to be.</p>",

            returned to the Abyss and the resurrected city of Dagonia has disappeared.
            Only the ancient ruins that lend the name of fortress to the island of
            Xapur remain. Flavia is safe; the mercenaries tend to their wounds as
            she emerges from the mist of terror that has poisoned her mind. As
            Conan helps the last Dagonian to rise in order to take her home to her
            family, his blue eyes blaze once again through his black mane. The
            Cimmerian barbarian no longer thinks of reward, for not all men seek
            rest and peace, some are born with the spirit of the storm in their
            veins, eternal messengers of violence and massacre, they know no other

              island, a terrible metallic cry resounds like a bronze bell from the
              top of the lush cliffs. The Devil in Iron is a prisoner of his island.
              Seeing the last Dagonian escape from him, he knows that it will be
              impossible for him to restore his full omnipotence, his magic is already

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>You are anchored in an isolated bay, three hundred miles north of Kordava when your captain starts throwing men to the sharks. 
        One buccaneer is accused of incit- ing a mutiny; another is forced overboard because the captain doesn’t like “the glint in his eye.” 
        Ever since the crew dropped anchor to trade with the Eagle-Picts, your normally taciturn leader has made all manner of erratic decisions. 
        Something foul occurred when he left for a tryst with the Pictish chief, and it’s clear to you he’s no longer the man he was. But despite 
        his sudden change in temperament, the crew remain loyal, and there are no signs of mutiny.</p>
        <p>“What madness is this?” you muse.</p>
        <p>You had decided to weather the captain’s stormy mood, to shrink back into the masses, losing yourself among the toothless 
        mouths and sun-leathered faces, </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>but then he targets a close companion of yours, suggesting the man has used sorcery to doom the vessel. Sure, he has dabbled 
        in black arts—the accusation is fair—but he’s not the summoner of demons the captain claims he is. Besides, your friend’s 
        sorcery has saved your blasted hide more than once.</p>
        <p>Honour-bound to your companion and seeing your leader has gone mad, you decide the time has come for the feast- ing of swords. You fill your hand with steel, 
        choose one of the captain’s faithful followers, and cleave his skull to the teeth. As his body crumples to the deck, the crew erupt in howls, choosing sides and 
        raising weapons. A quick glance from prow to stern paints a grim picture—you are grossly outnumbered. Your only hope is to hack through the wall of death and 
        wash the deck in a captain’s blood.</p>

          teeming with Picts, some of whom are already climbing the ship. Roll <img src="/assets/dice/Red-Reroll.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> to determine the number of Pict Hunters you will 
          place in <img src="/assets/tokens/area2Token.png" class="scen_token" />. Reroll the die once if the first result is blank. A maximum of 15 Pict Hunters can be on the board at one time.

        <p><span class="setup_item">Special Rules</span></p>
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Fire!</span> The invading Picts started a fire on your ship. Roll <img src="/assets/dice/Red-Reroll.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> 
        to determine the fire’s 
        intensity (shown as a 1, 2, or 3 on the Fire token). Reroll the die once if the first result is blank. Unless the reroll 
        is also blank, place the initial Fire token in any zone except <img src="/assets/tokens/area2Token.png" class="scen_token" /> 
        or the stairwell (marked with a chest). Subsequent Fire tokens must be placed in a zone adjacent to an existing Fire token.</p>
        <p>The number on the Fire token denotes how many unprevent- able wounds a miniature takes if they move into a Fire zone, 
        as well as any round they start in a zone with a Fire token. Each unit already in a zone when a Fire token is placed in 
        that zone immediately takes 1 unpreventable damage. Overlord miniatures will always avoid zones with a Fire token when moving. 
        If there is no way to reach a Target Hero or Alternate Target Hero, they will remain in their current zone when they activate 
        (even if they have Leap).</p>
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Leaping the Flames:</span> A Hero with Leap may leap over one zone containing a Fire token 
        to an adjacent zone. Follow the rules for Leap by considering each zone with a Fire token to be a leap area. The number 
        on the Fire token is the number they must match or beat by the red die roll. A Hero may never leap more than one zone as 
        part of the same action.</p>
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Outer Dark Demon:</span> The Pictish sorcerer has summoned a vile demon from the Outer Dark. 
        The Outer Dark Demon is unaffected by Fire tokens. The Outer Dark Demon will target the Strongest Hero.</p>
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Chests:</span> Place one chest in the stairwell zone of the ship to indicate where Heroes pick 
        up chests. This chest does not affect how many miniatures you can place in the zone (3 normal-sized miniatures is the threshold). 
        A Hero in this zone may spend one gem for a simple Manipulation to retrieve a chest. This chest counts as two encumbrance and may 
        be dropped for free or picked up again as a simple Manipulation. A Hero may only hold one chest at a time and may not throw the chest.</p>
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">The stairwell zone:</span> Only area <img src="/assets/tokens/area1Token.png" class="scen_token" /> 
        and the adjacent mast zone have line of sight to units in the stairwell zone.</p>

        <p>True to their nature, the mutinous pirates turn on you as soon as your feet hit the beach, demanding what meager

        treacherous dogs to a man!</p>
        <p>With a glint of steel, a thrown knife is planted in the gullet of the instigator, the tall, harsh Kushite first mate. 
        His eyes bulge as he chokes and sputters on the blood bubbling from his mouth. The distraction is enough to allow you to 
        make an escape. Threats and howls of rage ring out. Arrows zip by your heads as you dash headlong into the murky forest.
        <p>Climbing a wooded bluff in the dark, you hope to find a safe place in a seemingly abandoned signal tower overlooking the bay. 
        The entrance is blocked with rubble so you and your companions scurry to the top of the </p>

        three standing signal towers and one collapsed. The inner courtyard is crisscrossed with thick, almost rope like webs.</p>
        <p>You freeze as a dull chittering echoes around the stone walls. Moments pass. Silence. You begin to take a step and are greeted 
        by the same sound and notice a slight vibration in the enormous tangle of webs. You stop. Silence again.</p>
        <p>Suddenly you hear the clamor of the pirates ascending the bluff. You duck for cover as the first volley of arrows clatters 
        around the ramparts. The thick webs shrouding the courtyard begin to vibrate erratically. The chittering grows louder and more 
        incessant.</p>
      <p>The realization creeps over you. This is no safe place.</p>

        power is determined, if any die shows 2 or more symbols, the defender is moved into the Hidden Chamber after the attack is 
        completed.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Deep One Champion:</span> The Deep One Champion is considered a Deep One. It targets the

        <img src="/assets/tokens/poisonToken.png" class="scen_token" /> on their dashboard to match the number of Deep Ones 
        (or their corpses) in their area. The Hero’s maximum Encumbrance Value and Encumbrance limits for each skill are immediately 
        reduced by 1 for each Poison token <img src="/assets/tokens/poisonToken.png" class="scen_token" /> on their dashboard.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Lingering Stench:</span> If a Deep One is killed, place a red gem 
        <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" /> in the area to represent its corpse. A Hero in an area adjacent 
        to the cliff may perform a simple Manipulation (or use Telekinesis) to remove 1 <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" /> 
        from the map.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Zamorian Chain:</span> A Hero with the Zamorian chain that starts his turn in the Hidden 
        Chamber does not pay the extra movement point to exit the Hidden Chamber. The Hero with the Zamorian Chain is also immune 
        to Blocking until he exits the 1 Hidden Chamber.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">The Servant of Ahriman:</span> acts in the following order while chained:
        <ul>
          <li>Attempt to break free. Roll 1 <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> (no rerolls). 
          If the result is 2 or more symbols place, a red gem on its base. (See Break the Chains Event.)</li>
          <li>Attack Target Hero, if possible. While chained, the Servant of Ahriman does not move.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>Once freed, the Servant of Ahriman moves and targets normally. When the Servant of Ahriman reaches 5 Life points, reduce 
        its attack dice by 1 <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" />. At 0 Life Points, reduce its attack dice 
        by 1 additional <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" />. 
        After that, the Servant of Ahriman cannot be wounded any more.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Killing the Beast:</span> The only way to kill the Servant of Ahriman is to knock it off the 
        cliff. If the Servant of Ahriman is in an area adjacent to the cliff, the Heroes may attempt to knock it over the edge by 
        constricting it with the Zamorian Chain and giving it at least 1 wound with the Anchor in the same turn. If successful, the 
        Servant of Ahriman is dragged to a watery death. Discard the Anchor and Zamorian Chain, they are not carried over to the next 
        scenario.</p>

        <p>Exhausted from the constant fighting, you trek deeper into the forest, searching for somewhere to rest. It’s not long before 
        rustling leaves in the eerily silent woods alert you to a new danger: you are being hunted.</p>
        <p>Quickening your step, you begin to see signs of what passes for civilization in these parts; rabbit snares and vegetable 
          gardens. You recall the captain mentioning something about a village, and decide it is worth risking contact with the Pictish 
          natives.</p>
        <p>When you reach the village, you see damaged huts, hastily repaired as though a battle had been fought here recently. You hide 
        behind a hut when you spot other crewmembers from the Wastrel milling about some of the huts on the outer edge of the village. It 
        seems they’ve struck a bargain with the Eagle-Picts for overnight shelter.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>As a group, you decide to wait until nightfall and steal back the remaining treasure they stole from you. But as the moon slowly 
        creeps from behind the clouds, you sense a strange tingle through your spine. Something unnatu- ral was transpiring in this village, 
        an unseen evil rising from hell to gnaw on your nerves. Your mind flashes to the crown stored in one of those pirate crates, and you 
        know it can aid you in the coming fight against evil. But time grows short.</p>
        <p>Do you risk engaging the pirates in search of the crown, or rush through the village and smite the sorcerer before they can finish 
        their wicked incantation?</p>

        <p><span class="setup_item">Special Rules</span></p>

        <p>This scenario works differently than most scenarios. Activation tokens are not used to activate units, but rather to 
        randomly choose which units spawn in the huts. The number of activations does not depend on how many Heroes are on the board. 
        The Overlord turn always goes as follows:</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Overlord Turn Sequence</span></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Increase the time counter by 1.</li>
          <li>Roll  <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> 
          <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" />
          <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" />(no rerolls). If the result is less than the current round 
          (as indicated by the Time token), activate Event B. Otherwise, nothing happens.</li>
          <li>Activate all revealed Overlord units. Players choose the order of these attacks. Determine Target Hero or Alternate 
          Hero for each activating unit as normal.</li>
        </ol></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Map Notes:</span> Standard map rules apply. Treat the Barricade tokens as outer walls that 
        cannot be climbed over or wrecked using Wall Wrecker.</p>
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Huts:</span> The first time a hut is entered, flip the Activation token and read the 
        corresponding entry in the enemy chart below. Place the enemies listed in the hunt. Then roll <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" />  
        (no rerolls). If the result is a 2 or more, those enemies will interrupt the Heroes’ turn and activate, attempting to attack the Hero who entered the hut. 
        As soon as the revealed enemies have completed their activation, or if they did not get to activate, the Heroes will continue 
        their turn. Wall Wrecker will also trigger this effect, just as if the Hero entered through a door (regardless of where they 
        entered from). If Zogar Sag’s hut is chosen (Hut 1), activate Event A.</p>
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Zogar Sag:</span> For this scenario, Zogar Sag has the Protected skill.</p>
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Manifestation of Yog:</span> Horror extends to all adjacent areas with Line of Sight.</p>

        <p><span class="setup_item">Event A</span></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">The Ritual is Ruined:</span> Zogar Sag’s ritual has been interrupted. The alarm sounds and 
        the village awakes. Make the follow- ing changes to the board:</p>
        <p>Complete all the following in the order presented:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Flip each Activation token and spawn all enemies in each location as indicated in the Enemy Chart.</li>
          <li>Move Activation tokens 1-6 to the Book of Skelos. These tiles will now activate following standard activation rules 
          (draw 1 activation token per living Hero)</li>
          <li>The Pirates, Elite Ballista, and Captain flee the village. Remove their miniatures from the board and remove 1 chest 
          from each tent.</li>
        </ol></p>


        <p><span class="setup_item">Event B</span></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">The Ritual is Complete:</span> Zogar Sag has summoned a demon to cleanse his village. 
        As the Manifestation of Yog takes phys- ical form through the body of Zogar Sag, the village awakes. Make the following 
        changes to the board:</p>
        <p>Complete all the following in the order presented:
        <ol>
          <li>Replace the Zogar Sag tile with the Manifestation of Yog tile (15 Life Points).</li>
          <li>Flip each activation tile and spawn all enemies in each location as indicated in the Enemy Chart.</li>
          <li>Move Activation tokens 1-6 to the Book of Skelos. These tiles will now activate following standard activation 
          rules (draw 1 activation token per living Hero).</li>
        </ol></p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
      <p></p><p></p>

        <p>If the Heroes did not previously enter any tents marked B, the Pirates, Elite Ballista, and Captain will act as allies. 
        They can be activated by any Hero with the Leadership skill.</p>
        <p>If the Heroes previously entered any tents marked B, they will not aid in this fight and flee the village. Remove their

        <p>The Pictish shaman, his life fading, makes arcane gestures and traces sigils of gramarye, his final breath coming amongst 
        whispered words not meant for the human tongue. In the darkness of the bowels of the earth below the village, something stirs 
        in response...</p>
        <p>With the village secure, you turn your attention to the unknown threat that led you here. You recall overhearing a former 
        shipmate lamenting the loss of a map of the coast. The captured priest carrying it was consumed by a monstrous serpent in the 
        forest. You formulate a plan to lure the beast to the village to retrieve the map.</p>
        <p>Taking stakes from the crude palisade, you impale bodies on them, hoping the sight and smell will entice the serpent to enter 
        the village. Meanwhile, your sorcerous companion </p>

        <p>searches the shaman’s hut and discovers a scroll reveal- ing ancient lore about 
        summoning the serpents of these primeval forests - it reinforces the idea of using the dead to lure the ophidian monstrosity.</p>
        <p>As you wait for movement in the verdant foliage outside the village, you note with alarm faint sounds from below the ground, 
        and increasing tremors beneath your feet.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, howls and barking rend the air. From the gates pour a horde of beasts, intent on scavenging in a blood frenzy. 
        The snake is not among them...</p>
        <p>“Burn the bodies!” cries out the Sorceror, recalling more of the scroll. “The flames will dissuade the carrion-eaters and it 
        is part of the summoning ritual!”</p>

        <p><span class="setup_item">Special Rules</span></p>

        <p>This scenario works differently than most scenarios. Activation tokens are not used to activate units, but rather to randomly choose which units spawn. The number of acti- vations does not depend on how many Heroes are on the board. The Overlord turn always goes as follows:
        
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Overlord Turn Sequence</span></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Advance the Turn marker</li>
          <li>Activate all revealed enemy units. Players choose the order in which to activate these units.</li>
          <li>Spawn a monster in one of the areas with a reinforce- ment token. The location alternates each turn, so place the 
          monster at location 1 at the ends of turn 1, 3, 5, etc. and at location 2 at the ends of turn 2, 4, 6, etc.</li>
        </ol></p>

        <p><img src="/assets/tokens/trapDoorX.png" class="scen_event float_tile">
        <span class="special_solo_title">Trap Door:</span> Heroes may spend one Movement Point to explore a Trap Door token and flip it. 
        If the back of the token has an X, it is a dead end. If the Trap Door token has a number, place the Hero in the Hidden Chamber 
        with the corresponding Trap Door number and spawn a random monster in the chamber. The monster will interrupt the Heroes’ turn 
        and activate. Once the monster has finished with its activation, the Heroes will continue their turn. Units may spend 1 Movement 
        Point to move between a room and its corresponding Hidden Chamber, but they do not have line of sight to each other.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Monster Spawns:</span> When you need to spawn a random monster, follow the rules for drawing 
        an Activation token from the Book of Skelos, but instead of activating the corre- sponding unit, place its miniature in the 
        intended location. If the monster is already on the board, draw another token. If all monsters are on the board, do not 
          spawn another monster. Once all Activation tokens are in the Fatigue zone in the Book of Skelos, flip them face down, 
          shuffle them, and place them back in the Reserve.</p>

        is blank, place a Pit Trap (max 3) in the area. If it’s not blank, place a random Fire Trap in the area with the 1 side up. 
        The Hero that triggered the trap immediately suffers the effect but does not lose any remaining free Movement Points.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Pit Trap:</span> When a unit enters an area with a Pit Trap, roll 1 
        <img src="/assets/dice/Orange.png" class="scen_sq_token" />(no rerolls allowed) and suffer unblockable damage equal to the 
        result. Leaving this area costs 1 additional movement point for Heroes without Climb. In addition, Heroes with Climb may 
        choose to spend 1 extra movement point when entering the area to take no damage. Heroes with flying, and all Overlord units, 
        are unaffected by Pit Traps.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Fire Trap:</span> Heroes take unblockable damage equal to the value on a Fire Trap token 
        whenever they:
        <ul>
          <li>enter an area with a Fire Trap token, or</li>
          <li>start their turn in an area with a Fire Trap token.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>Overlord units are unaffected by Fire Traps.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Wells:</span> Heroes may use a simple Manipulation to investigate a face down number token to 
        search for a secret well. Flip the token. If it is a 1, place the Well token in the room. Spawn the Deep One Champion in the 
        room and activate it.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Sunken Key:</span> A Hero in the same area as the Well may retrieve the Key by performing a 
        complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 4.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Water Buckets:</span> A Hero in the same area as the Well may fill a water bucket by performing 
        a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 2. Use a Water token to represent the bucket with a weight of 2.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Dousing the Fire:</span> A Hero with a Water token may perform a simple Manipulation and 
        discard the Water token to remove a Fire Trap token from their area, or an adjacent area if they have line of sight.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Nameless Horror:</span> At the end of the Overlord’s turn 10, spawn the Nameless Horror at 
        spawn location 2 instead of a random spawn. In addition, flip all Fire Trap tokens on the board to the side with the higher 
        number. From now on, whenever spawning a Fire Trap token, flip it to the side with the higher number after randomly drawing it.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Moonlight glitters upon the placid water of a small bay. Jagged cliffs encircle it, shaped like a horseshoe, offering 
        protection from the turbulent sea beyond. Its mouth is sealed off with a thick length of chain, preventing passage in or out, 
        but a look around the decaying village suggests none have visited this port for many years. Despite your scouting efforts, it 
        remains unclear who the original denizens were. Fishermen? Was this a military fortification? A pirate refuge? In such 
        disrepair are the structures that the port’s original purpose cannot be determined.</p>
        <p>But that is of little concern. What matters is the ship still afloat on the sparkling water, its rigging and sails intact. 
        If you can but loose that chain, you should be able to sail south </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>along the Western shore and back to civilization without 
        further aggression from the devils of the forest. The links of the chain are mighty, made to withstand any handheld weapons, 
        but with the right tools, you should be able to release the lock and sail to freedom.</p>
        <p>One of the decayed buildings catches your eye. The soft glow emanating from its shattered windows would be welcoming if the 
        rest of the scene wasn’t so damned foreboding. If there’s any chance of finding the tools to drop that chain, you expect to 
        find them there. Besides, the familiar howls from beyond the tree line—the awful peal of man-eating ghouls—makes the gloomy 
        structure a bit more appealing.</p>

        <p>Place the Table, Chair, and Barrel tokens as indicated. In addition, place the Wall Wrecker tokens to act as Breach

        <p><span class="setup_item">Asset Deck</span></p>
        <p>There is no Asset Deck in this scenario. However, set the Yuetshi Knife, Spellbook (Whirlwind), Key, and Tools equipment 
        cards near the Player area, since they will be used in the scenario. Also, set aside Scale Mail, Anchor, and Gift of Life as 
        the rewards for success.</p>


        <p><span class="setup_item">Special Rules</span></p>

        <p>This scenario works differently than most scenarios. Activation tokens are not used to activate units, but rather to 
        randomly choose which units spawn. The number of acti- vations does not depend on how many Heroes are on the board. 
        The Overlord turn always goes as follows:</p>
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Overlord Turn Sequence</span></p>

        <ol>
          <li>Roll for Event effects and complete steps and associated activations (see below)</li>
          <li>Activate all revealed enemy units. Players choose the order in which to activate these units.</li>
          <li>Activate all revealed monsters (those that have been revealed behind doors; see Doors below), but not the Ghouls—they 
          only attack during the Event. Players may choose the order of these attacks. Determine Target Hero or Alternate Hero for 
          each activating monster as normal.</li>
        </ol></p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6">
      <p></p><p></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Map notes:</span> Areas with a Boulder token are inaccessible and can’t be entered by any means 
        (including Intangible). Wall Wrecker cannot be used in this scenario.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Breach, Table, Chair, and Barrel Tokens:</span> The areas with Breach tokens serve as entry zones 
        for Ghouls. Heroes carry- ing a Table, Chair, or Barrel token may perform a simple Manipulation to plug the breach by placing 
          the token on top of a Breach token. Only one token may be on top of a Breach token at a time. When Breach tokens are covered 
          in this way, Ghouls can no longer enter this area via the event.</p>
        <p>Heroes may perform a simple Manipulation to pick up a Table, Chair, or Barrel token, each of which have an encumbrance of 2. 
        They may be dropped any time for free. If you attack or are attacked while holding one of these tokens, you may add one to your 
        Defense for the round, but must drop it in your area after the attack is resolved. You must also drop one of these tokens to make 
        an attack.</p>
        <p>When a Table, Chair, or Barrel token is removed from a Breach token, remove it from the game.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Doors and Monsters:</span> Doors require a simple Manipulation to open. Each time a door is opened, 
        draw an Activation token and follow the instructions according to the corresponding number.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Ghouls:</span> Ghouls follow the standard activation rules but only activate as dictated by the 
        Event. Their tile should not be placed in the River. Ghouls have one life point each.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Khosatral Khel:</span> Khosatral Khel does not activate until his door is opened. A Hero who 
        possesses the Key can open this door by performing a simple Manipulation. When the door is opened, roll 
        <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" />. If the result is 2 or greater, activate Khosatral Khel and target 
        the Hero who opened the door. Khosatral Khel is immune to damage caused by spells. A Hero who attacks Khosatral Khel with the 
        Yuetshi Knife reduces his armor to 6 for that attack. When he’s killed, place the Tools Equipment card in his zone.</p>

        <p>As you sail onward, a sudden and mighty storm strikes, roiling the sea and carrying with it a thick and preternatural mist. 
        Progress slows until the storm abates—to a degree at least. The mist, while lessened, still makes navi- gation nigh impossible.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the ship is rocked by a collision and you see an ancient, decrepit ship alongside yours. After recovering from the 
        impact and surprise, you board it; what little can be made out through the swirling mist shows a ship fashioned in a style not 
        seen for countless ages. Debris covers the deck, some of which appears to be skeletal remains.</p>
        <p>While examining the ship, you lose sight of each other through the mist. You query one of your companions and are greeted with 
        silence - which is then broken by a cry</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>of alarm. The mist comes alive with a coruscant illumination of various hues, so you move toward the source. As the mist 
        thins, you see a large ornate mirror at the stern of the ship. Bones from the deck begin to glow and rustle. Then, they 
          swirl and form some sort of serpent men from legend!</p>
        <p>Below the elevated deck whereon sits the mirror, a final swirling of bones resolves itself into a massive serpent, with eyes 
        that burn with human sentience and unguessed malevolence. Behind this ophidian menace you see the mirror no longer emits the 
        lights that drew you to it, but rather a fading scene wherein your companion is on a different ship, battling for his life - and 
        you sense you must destroy the mirror before the scene is fully gone to return them to your side!</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Map Notes:</span> Normal map rules apply, except the ships are in different ages and have no 
        interaction during gameplay.

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Mirror of Tuzun Thune:</span> The mirror of Tuzun Thune is located on the ship in the 
        Hyborian Age, but Thulsa Doom cast a spell of illusion masking its location. To reveal the mirror in the Hyborian Age, 
        the Stygian Artifact must be destroyed in the Thurian Age.
        
        <p>Once revealed, the mirror <img src="/assets/tokens/energyToken.png" class="scen_token" /> has 12 Life Points, is immune to 
        all spell effects, and has 3 Armor. Destroying the Mirror of Tuzun Thune within the allotted time returns all unit to their 
        respective Ages.
        
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Map:</span> When a Hero picks up the map, immediately roll 
        <img src="/assets/dice/Yellow.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> (no rerolls allowed). If the 
        result is blank, place the <img src="/assets/tokens/energyToken.png" class="scen_token" /> token in the area marked 
        <img src="/assets/tokens/areaAToken.png" class="scen_token" /> A on the 
        ship in the Thurian Age. If the result is not blank, place it in the area marked 
        <img src="/assets/tokens/areaBToken.png" class="scen_token" /> B on the ship in the Thurian Age. This 
        represents the location where the Stygian Artifact must be destroyed.

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Stygian Artifact:</span> A Hero carrying the Stygian Artifact may ignore Jinx. To destroy

        token. The Hero must have the Tools equipment card and perform a complex Manipulation with difficulty of 3. Once the Stygian 
        Artifact is destroyed, move the <img src="/assets/tokens/energyToken.png" class="scen_token" /> token to the corresponding 
        location on the ship in the Hyborian Age. The spell has been broken and the Mirror of Tuzun Thune is visible.

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Thulsa Doom:</span> When Thulsa Doom activates, he will act in the following order: 1. 
        Cast Yog’s Hunger 2. Activate as normal

        the sight of them. Even though they don’t deserve to enjoy the comforts of civilization, you can’t man this ship alone. Holding 
        your tongue, you climb down the rigging. Ignoring their suspicious glances, you make for land.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching the docks, you soon realize Kordava is not how you recall. The guards and town folk glare at you, and even the

        <p>The ungrateful companion whose hide you saved a lifetime ago turns to you. “Something is wrong, my friend. Though I am

        <p>“It sounds simple to me,” interrupts the rogue. “Let’s raid the temple. We can gather all the relics,” he continues,

      plunges deeper into the nighted halls of the dead. But what brings the King of Aquilonia
      to these labyrinthine depths beneath black-walled Khemi? After all, a man of the north has
      as much cause to visit a Stygian city as a wolf does a pit of snakes. But somewhere in this
      crypt, among the remains of long-dead kings, queens, and generals of ancient Stygia, lies
      the heart of Ahriman--an uncanny bloodstone of the Acheronian Empire and King Conan's only
      hope of regaining his throne.</p>
      <p>Knowing the Heart is near, he stalks closer, noting the black robes and flashing blades of
      the acolytes surrounding an altar. On top of this lie the mummified remains of Thothmekri--an
      adept of the Black Ring--stirring with unnatural life, bathed in the ruby glow of a great jewel
      burning upon his breast. One of the robed priests looms over the altar, chanting strange words
      and raising his hands in exultation...</p>

      description: "<p>The echo of an earth-shattering explosion fades as chunks of rubble
      smashed and ricocheted into the courtyard. Thick smoke billowed from the gaping hole
      that moments ago was a fortified iron gate. “Steal yourselves, men!” Conan called from
      the opposite ramparts. Nervous soldiers, plastered with dust and soot, slowly rose from
      cover and tightened the grip of their weapons.</p>
      <p>A green aura glowed in the tower behind them as sorcerers recited ancient incantations.
      As the light reached the granite statue of Mitra in the courtyard below, debris dislodged
      from joints dormant for centuries. The divine fury of a benevolent deity pushed beyond the
      limits of mercy slowly came to life, incarnate in living stone. Conan loathed sorcery, but
      these were desperate times.</p>
      <p>As the dust cloud thinned, an enormous slithering horror loomed where the iron gate once
      stood. All the horror of Acheron manifest itself in that writhing mound of flesh. The avatar
      of Yog, the cannibal god, lashed out with its greedy tentacles, snatching soldiers and dashing
      their brains upon the walls.</p>
      <p>Conan stood upon the wall, senses reeling as the horrid entity trundled into the courtyard.
       “Crom,” he gasped, fighting to quash the urge to flee that welled up in any man when confronted
       with such extraterrestrial otherness. Thews tightened, his senses cleared. He knew what to do.
        Drawing his sword, Conan shouted, “Courage, men! There’s nothing in the Universe that cold steel
        won’t cut.”</p>",

      correction: '
        <p><strong>Divine Fury:</strong> When the Manifestation of Mitra uses Wall Wrecker with this special rule, it can push the
        Manifestation of Yog to an adjacent area of its choice, even if it has to go through a stone wall (see
        Staggering Gods special rule). This can on ly happen in this specific case.
        Apart from that, normal Allies’ Activatio n rules apply (cost in gems) as well as normal Wall Wrecker rules (cost
        in movement points), and the Manifestation of Mitra is affected by Hindering. Divine Fury occurs during the
        movement of the Manifestation of Mitra, which can then perform a normal attack. Divine Fury only reduces
        the Manifestation of Yog’s Armor value, it does not cause damage.</p>
        <p><strong>Ethereal Attack:</strong> When the Manifestation of Yog uses Intangible with this special rule, this does not cost gems
        (unless the Overlord spends gems for a Movement Benefit ). For example, if the Manifestation of Yog is in an
        area adjacent to the Manifestation of Mitra, this will only cost 1 movement point.
        See also Clarification o n Divine Fury, above.</p>
        <p><strong>“There’s nothing in the Universe cold steel won’t cut”:</strong> Once reduced to 0, Armor remains at 2 for the rest of the game and cannot be reduced by
        Divine Fury or E thereal Attack. But Divine Fury and Ethereal Attack can still be used to push a Manifestation.</p>
        <p><strong>Yog’s Hunger:</strong> This special rule no longer applies after the Manifestation of Mitra’s Armor value is reduced to 0
        and reset to 2. However, Yog’s Hunger can still be used normally on any enemy unit .</p>
        <p><strong>Rockslide Areas:</strong> This special rule replaces the standard game board rule.</p>',

      description: "<p>The doomed crew had made a bold stand. They lay, feathered thoroughly with
      pirate arrows. Heavily armed mercenaries and port thugs were boarding the sinking ship
      ready to claim their prize; a stowaway Vendhyan princess.</p>
      <p>Conan and his companions had embarked on a ship sailing from Ahgrapur and, not
      two days into the voyage, the stowaway was discovered. She told a harrowing tale of
      escaping the relentless advances of a petty noble, the satrap of an insignificant
      city state.</p>
      <p>The princess fled, using her jewelry and her charm to reach Ahgrapur. Out of jewels
      and out of ideas she had stolen onto the ship only to be discovered amidst the cargo.
      Shortly thereafter black sails appeared on the horizon. A slaver’s ship, out of Khawarism,
      in dogged pursuit.</p>
      <p>The jilted suitor had spent enough money, or enough sorcery, to convince these sea dogs
      to spill their lives in his service. Their glazed eyes strongly suggested sorcery.</p>
      <p>Conan quickly realized the pirates’ objective; the princess. He wrenched his sword free
      from a twitching pirate corpse and cursed; “The devil take that woman and my blade will take
      the rest!” </p>",

      description: "<p>“Before Arus, well-meaning servant of Mitra, came unto the Picts
      there existed no word for “subtlety” in the Pictish tongue.” - The Nemedian Chronicles</p>
      <br />
      <p>Gorm and his tribal warriors have traveled down the Black River into the Zingaran borderland.
      The Pict leader is young and fierce, but his heart desires iron weapons, for such a thing would
      surely secure his hold on power. In some unnamed town, he lurks outside a ramshackle inn with
      three highly trained mercenaries on a special mission: kidnap a Cimmerian who is said to have
      knowledge of weaponsmithing.</p>
      <p>Gorm learned of the weaponsmith from another Cimmerian, a wanderer looking to make a quick
      handful of coins. To aid them in capturing the man alive, Gorm enlisted the aid of another
      mercenary, a devotee of a mysterious sect specializing in unarmed combat. The final mercenary,
      a woman claiming royal blood who rebelled against the pampered life to become a rogue, had
      already entered the inn, promising to persuade the Cimmerian to come willingly or sedate him
      if that failed.</p>
      <p>“Where is the signal?” Gorm growled, fingering his mace.</p>
      <p>“Patience, Gorm,” the warrior replied. “She has only been inside a moment.”</p>
      <p>“The woman takes too long - we take what we want, NOW!” With a roar, the Pictish chief
      charged the door, shattering it inwards to the surprise of the pirates gathered therein, and
      to the dismay of Octavia among then, separated from her allies.</p>",

      To remove the energy field, the Heroes must
      release the three spells maintaining its power. To release a spell, a Hero must
      be in the area of the spell’s source <img src="/assets/tokens/numBackToken.png" class="scen_token" />
      and spend 1 gem on a simple Manipulation.
      Once all three spells have been released, remove the energy field token and place
      a Pict Hunter miniature with a red base in the area to represent Korum-ta.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Korum-ta:</span> Korum-ta is unconscious, counts
        as an object with an encumbrance value of 6, and can be picked up by a Hero

        Whenever the Nameless Horror is summoned, it has all its gems in its Reserve
        zone. The Nameless Horror is dismissed at the end of the round unless the
        Overlord leaves 2 gems on the Summon Demon card. The Overlord can dismiss
        the Nameless Horror at any time by moving those gems to the Fatigue zone.
        If the Nameless Horror is dismissed or dies, it drops any objects it was
        carrying in its area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Activating the Nameless Horror:</span> After
        the Overlord finishes their turn each Round, the Nameless Horror takes its
        turn. The Nameless Horror does not suffer the effects of unarmed penalty,
        but may equip and use weapons like a Hero. The Nameless Horror does not recover
        gems as normal. Instead, it must use a free action during its activation to
        consume an Overlord-controlled minion it can access with its Reach skill.
        Each minion consumed in this manner restores 1 gem from its Fatigue zone to
        its Reserve zone. There is no limit to the number of times the Nameless Horror
        can use this free action. Consumed minions may NOT use Attack from Beyond.
        Remove consumed minions from the game board once eaten.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Doors:</span> A Hero in an area adjacent to a
        door can perform a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 3 to pick the
        lock. Overlord units may freely move through doors. In either case, whenever
        any unit moves through a door, remove the door from the game board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Fleeing the Abandoned Fort:</span>
        A hero can flee the Abandoned Fort from an area at the edge of the game board
        by spending movement points as though moving across a border and removing the
        Hero’s miniature from the game board. Once a Hero has fled, the Hero’s miniature
        cannot be returned to the game board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Game Board Rules:</span> Standard game board rules
        apply. Despite its base size, the Nameless Horror can fit into any area. Refer

      description: "<p>The siren song of ancient treasure lured the crew of the Tigress
      onto a fog shrouded cove. The fabled Citadel of Dagon brooded above, built into
      the jagged cliffs. The ship suddenly struck a reef. Bêlit cursed. Obviously, a trap.
      She should have been more cautious.</p>
      <p>The crew worked into the night to free the ship. Suddenly, a hideous screech bellowed
      out from above followed by a terrible flapping of wings. A hapless crewman cried out
      and disappeared aloft, into the fog.</p>
      <p>Bêlit and Conan quickly made for shore with a small, terrified crew. They tracked the
      winged horror to a cliff side cave. A smooth, algae covered stairway led down and opened
      up into a sprawling gallery. A foul temple of Dagon, reeking of sea creatures and leaking
      pungent water from every crack in the ceiling. Oily torchlight flickered, reflecting off
      the hijacked treasure of centuries of ships wrecked on the reefs. Forgetting the danger,
      the crew gasped in astonishment and started toward the treasure.</p>
      <p>“Caution fools!” Conan hissed, but it was too late. The crew wandered into the depths
      of the citadel, filling their pouches with loot. It was then Conan noticed the bulbous fish
      eyes peering at them from the dank corners of the temple. Then the screech of the Winged One
      filled the gallery</p>
      <p>Conan turned to flee the gallery. Bêlit shook off his hand clutching her wrist. The
      madness of greed burned in the Pirate Queen’s eyes. She would not leave until she had enough
      gold to pay her crew...or replace them.</p>",

      vessel of the former Zingaran grandee turned renegade and freebooter, the Cimmerian’s
      personality, military prowess, and seamanship have made him very popular with the crew.
      He has gained influence and is viewed as the true leader of the ship. While Zaporavo has
      underestimated this Northern barbarian, he remains nonetheless wary of the man he now
      views as a rival who must be taken out. Shortly after the easy capture of a peaceful

      Preposterous legends tell of how the sea witch found a companion, a man of iron
      whose wrath rivals that of a wounded lion. When survivors of the plundered Stygian
      ships pronounce the names of Bêlit and Conan, they cast curses. However, the Tigress
      continues to roam the seas, devastating the southern coasts, but does not hesitate
      to venture further north, even beyond the lands of Shem. </p>
      <p>There, unaware of the terrible, lurking threat, a ship flying the royal banner
      of Aquilonia sails toward the Khorotas River, its destination the province of Poitain.
      The vessel’s precious cargo, originally from the Kingdom of Kush, surely explains the
      one thing that separates it from all others who sail within these waters: A large
      garrison of Bossonian soldiers equipped to counter any act of piracy and to scuttle
      the ship in case of failure. The sun is just rising when the lookout gives a shout of
      warning. A long deadly shape approaches from the starboard side: A serpentine,
      tapering galley with a raised deck extending from bow to stern. Forty oars on each
      side propel it quickly through the water. At the very top of the mast floats a long
      scarlet pennant, ominous emblem of the queen of fire, steel, and carnage...along with
      her terrible Cimmerian lover.</p>",

      religion of Python in the ancient Kingdom of Acheron has come back to life.
      In the three thousand years since the fall of Acheron, his destiny has inexorably
      linked to an extraordinary jewel which some claim is the veritable heart of a
      god, while others believe it to be a star fallen from the sky: The Heart of Ahriman.
      Exiled to Stygia, then mummified through the evil arts of the priests of Set,
      Xaltotun hid the heart in a haunted cave before his death and built a small temple
      above it. Three times the temple was rebuilt, growing ever bigger and more
      sumptuous, though its original purpose was forgotten. Mankind lost all knowledge
      of the hidden symbol, and only the sacred books and arcane works retained its
      memory. However, no secret lasts forever. The heart was finally stolen by bold
      thieves; a band of pirates, followers of the code of the Red Brotherhood and led
      by a Cimmerian warrior as fearsome as he was fearless. But today these scoundrels
      will pay the price of their daring, the price of blood, for Xaltotun cannot let

      mercenaries, the former High Priest of Set has taken off in pursuit of the desecrators

      almighty power of its dark sorcery. Driven mad over nearly three thousand years
      during which his soul was held behind the gates of hell, he now has only one
      ambition: to resurrect the black and ancient empire, during which he stacked
      heads to the glory of Set, to build pyramids in Python’s great square, while the
      kings returned from the West with their booty and prisoners. In order to set his
      dark plans into motion and initiate the resurrection of Acheron, the former High
      Priest sails into the open sea to perform an unholy ceremony designed to summon
      the most fearsome perils from the deep. Abyssal Allies destined to form the
      foundation of an army that will enable to overthrow all opposition from the
      Hyborian Kingdoms.</p>
      <p>Blinded by his desire for power and literally hypnotized by the jewel’s
      supernatural brilliance, Xaltotun was, however, over-confident. He clearly
      underestimated the Cimmerian who stole the Heart and his desire for revenge,
      his desire to take back what he considered to be his, driven also by the greed
      of his lover, the stubborn and cruel pirate captain--Bêlit. As Xaltotun begins
      his ritual, his ship is boarded by vengeful pirates, out for blood.</p>",

        in the same area as the Armlet may ignore Jinx and Protected (the Armlet does not
        need to be equipped). When the <img src="/assets/tokens/num1Token.png" class="scen_token" />
        token is revealed, replace it with the Halo of Mitra token. Once a Hero spends 1 for a
        simple Manipulation to pick up this item, place this token around their base. It has
        zero weight (encumbrance) and may be thrown, passed, or dropped like any other item.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">The Portcullis Lever:</span> When the
        <img src="/assets/tokens/num2Token.png" class="scen_token" /> token is revealed, Heroes
        may pull the Portcullis Lever to seal off the castle and trap all trespassers. To do
        so they must be in the same area as the <img src="/assets/tokens/num2Token.png" class="scen_token" />
        token and spend 1 for a simple Manipulation. When they do this, all areas highlighted in
        yellow can no longer be crossed or accessed by any means. Use whichever tokens you wish
        to denote this. Any miniatures (including Bossonian Guards) in these blocked zones are trapped.
        Immediately remove them from the board, and place any Serpent-men back in the Overlord’s
        pool; they may be brought back via the Event tile. Thulsa Doom is the exception. If he is
        trapped in any of these areas, he must use his Teleportation spell to cross over any
        blocked areas.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">The Guards:</span> The Bossonian Guards represent Kull’s
        elite fighting men, the Red Slayers. Under Thulsa Doom’s spell they are in a catatonic
        state, unable to move or speak, making it easy for Serpent-men to usurp their identities.
        For game play purposes, they are used by the Overlord to replace with Serpent-men. For all
        other purposes, they may be ignored. Guards are ignored for the purpose of determining
        Whirlwind damage. Bossonian Guards do not count for determining victory conditions; if all
        Serpent-men have been removed from the board, but there are still Bossonian Guards, the Heroes
        still win.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Chests:</span>
        During setup, the Overlord places 2 chest tokens on the board as indicated by the

      description: "<p>King Conan had suffered more threats than he had wounds to his flesh.
      Some arrived on the quivering lips of Nemedian heralds; others were carried by the
      beat of Pictish drums. After the Year of the Dragon had ended and Conan managed
      to recover his throne from the most formidable foe he’d ever faced, he hoped for
      peace. Nay, he demanded peace!</p>
      <p>But when his closest advisor arrived in his chamber with two emissaries from
      an unnamed kingdom--two men who claimed to have stepped out of the mists of
      time--Conan knew peace would remain a distant memory. Why couldn’t it be the
      Nemedians again or even the Stygians? By Crom, he’d welcome a wave of howling
      Picts, if it meant avoiding the plots of sorcerers or devils from the Outer Dark!</p>
      <p>It would not be so simple, however. The advisors brought news that Conan’s
      scouts and spies reported having seen King Conan and Queen Zenobia at an inn less
      than a day’s ride from Tarantia, apparently parleying with sworn enemies of Aquilonia.
      Knowing that he and the queen had not left his keep of a fortnight, Conan bristled
      at the implication. He would find out who dared usurp their royal identities and
      how they did it. And what of these strangers from the past? What brought them here,
      and why would they offer him aid? Sighing wearily, Conan reached for his goblet of
      wine and drained it in a single gulp. “Find your tongues, then,” he said.</p>",

        <p><span class="special_title">The Scourge of Set:</span> The Scourge of Set is an
        abomination created by the necromantic sorcery of Thulsa Doom. During its creation,
        Doom bestowed some of his immortal essence to the beast and is therefore part of it.
        As long as the Scourge of Set is alive, Doom may neither targeted or harmed by any
        attacks. Once the Scourge has been killed, Doom may be targeted normally. The Scourge
        of Set has 10 Life Points. For this scenario the Scourge of Set is considered an
        Oversized unit (see page 3 in the Tome of Skelos).</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Thulsa Doom:</span> Thulsa Doom cannot be targeted by
        an attack until the Scourge of Set has been killed. He may still activate and affect
        Heroes with his Skills as normal. Thulsa Doom has 10 Life Points. When Thulsa Doom is
        killed, remove his miniature and replace it with the
        <img src="/assets/tokens/flameToken.png" class="scen_token" /> token, which represents
        his skull. The skull has 1 weight (encumbrance) and is subject to the same rules as other
        items (for passing, throwing, dropping, etc.). Thulsa Doom has the Attack from Beyond skill
        for this scenario.</p>

        <p><span class="special_title">Destroying the Skull of Thulsa Doom:</span> Being an
        immortal necromancer, Doom can only be destroyed if his skull is obliterated. To do
        this, the Heroes must place it in the area containing the large brazier at the top of
        the stairs (marked on the diagram with <img src="/assets/tokens/energyToken.png" class="scen_token" />).
        It may be dropped or thrown into the area. As soon as it’s there, the Heroes win the game.</p>

        <p><span class="setup_item">Setup</span></p>
        <p><strong>The game starts with the Overlord’s turn.</strong> The Heroes start in the area marked 
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="/assets/tokens/area1Token.png" class="scen_token" />.</span> Place 
        1 <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" /> on the board to represent an Apple of Derketo.</p>

        <p><span class="setup_item">Asset Deck</span></p>
        <p>Chests require a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 2 to open. The Asset deck contains: Empty Chest x2, Life 
        Potion x2, Spellbook (Mitra’s Healing), Two-Handed Sword.</p>

        <p><span class="setup_item">Special Rules</span></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Game Board Rules:</span> Standard game board rules apply.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Dragon:</span> The Dragon of Xuchotl targets the Strongest Hero. Contrary to standard rules, 
        its Reach ability allows it to attack units at a different elevation as long as it has line of sight. The Dragon does not 
        lose life points except by poison (see Poisoning the Dragon). If the Dragon ever activates and cannot reach any target, move 
        it to the nearest area adjacent to a Deep Water area and remove 1 <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" /> from 
        its tile (if possible).</p>
       
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Camel:</span> The Camel tries to exit the board from the area with the 
        <img src="/assets/tokens/flame3Token.png" class="scen_token" /> token. When moving, the Camel will avoid hindering if possible. 
        Whenever a Camel is killed, lay the miniature down and add a chest to the area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Crocodiles:</span> Whenever a Crocodile is killed, flip the miniature upside down.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Apples of Derketo:</span> The Apples of Derketo grow on the side of the cliff. A Hero in the 
        area with the <img src="/assets/tokens/flameToken.png" class="scen_token" /> token may perform a simple Manipulation to move 1 
        <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" /> from the board to their Hero sheet, or a complex Manipulation 
        with a difficulty of 4 for a Hero in the area with the <img src="/assets/tokens/flame2Token.png" class="scen_token" /> token. 
        Apples cannot be traded, dropped, or thrown.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Poisoning the Dragon:</span> A Hero can apply poison to a melee or ranged weapon with a simple 
        Manipulation by discarding 1 <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" />. Move the 
        <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" /> to the Weapon card. Poison lasts for 1 attack. If that attack 
        exceeds the Dragon of Xuchotl’s Armor, place the <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" /> on the Dragon’s 
        tile. Otherwise, discard the <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" /> on the Weapon card. At the start of 
        the Overlord’s turn, the Dragon suffers 1 unavoidable damage for each <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" /> 
        on its tile.</p>

          range, the Dragon moves to that area and eats one. Remove the laid down miniature and increase the Dragon’s life points by 2 
          (15 max). Otherwise, the Dragon targets the Strongest Hero. Either way, add 1 
          <img src="/assets/tokens/redGem.png" class="scen_token" /> to the Apple of Derketo starting area.</li>

          movement points (for a total of 5). Target the furthest Hero it can reach and choose a route that passes through the most 
          areas with Heroes/Allies (without backtracking). Perform a

          against each Hero/Ally in every area the Dragon enters (including the destination area).</li>

        <p>The game ends once the last surviving Hero escapes. If all the Heroes are killed and none escaped, the scenario ends in defeat.</p>


        <p><span class="setup_item">Setup</span></p>
        <p>Form a Spell deck with the following Spell cards: Changing Destiny, Deceleration, Set’s Bite, Lightning Storm, Tears of 
        Dagon, Withering.</p>
        <p><strong>The game starts with the Overlord’s turn.</strong> The Heroes start in the areas marked

        <p><span class="setup_item">Special Rules</span></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Game Board Rules:</span> Standard game board rules apply. A Hero with Climb must spend 2 
        extra movement points to cross a border with a Web <img src="/assets/tokens/webToken.png" class="scen_token" /> token. 
        Overlord units may cross borders with a Web token for no extra cost. Web tokens on borders block line of sight. Borders with a 
        Boulder <img src="/assets/tokens/rocksToken.png" class="scen_token" /> token cannot be crossed and block line of sight.</p>
        
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Escape:</span> A Hero may exit the board from a reinforcement area 
        <img src="/assets/stats/reinforcement.png" class="scen_token" /> by spending movement points as though crossing a border. 
        A Hero that escapes the board is NOT considered to be killed; they are still counted for the number of Activation tokens 
        to be drawn.</p>
       
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Skulls of My Enemies:</span> When the Burning Skull is killed, lay the miniature down in 
        the area instead of removing it from the board. The Burning Skull’s skills are still in effect. A Hero who is not under 
        the effects of Fascination can perform a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 2 to crush the skull and receive 
        a <img src="/assets/tokens/treasureToken.png" class="scen_token" /> token. When the skull is crushed, return the Burning Skull 
        to its starting area and stand it up.</p>
       
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Burning Skull:</span> If the Burning Skull is laying down when activated, stand it back up 
        and activate it as normal.</p>
        
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Crawler:</span> Targets the Strongest Hero.</p>
        
        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Giant Spider:</span> Attacks the closest Hero with a 
        Web <img src="/assets/tokens/webToken.png" class="scen_token" /> token. If no Hero has a Web token, the Giant Spider will 
        use Web Projection on the closest Hero, if it isn’t hindered, instead of its attack. If it is hindered, the Giant Spider 
        will attack a Hero in its area.</p>

        will not move if there is a door between them and their Target Hero, except for the Soulless, who will move to the door

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Grab Him!:</span> A Hero in the same area as Tolkemec with the Whip or Rope can perform a 
        complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 1 to capture Tolkemec. He remains captured until the start of the next Overlord’s

      through the tropical vegetation. Her head perked up and he froze, listening for the sound of whatever caught her attention. 
      With a beastly howl, Pictish warriors emerged from the brush all around them.</p>
      <p>Conan drew his sword and the Picts paused, as if sensing their prey would not be as easy as they initially thought. Their 
      war cry changed pitch into a series of guttural roars, as if calling for help. Conan tensed, ready to spring at the lead warrior 
    when the guttural roars echoed back from the forest, far louder than the Picts had chanted and accompanied a thunderous shaking. 
      Suddenly, a dragon emerged from the forest. Shockingly, it ignored the Picts and almost seemed to obey them. How could this tribe 
      have domesticated such a terrible creature? Determination gripped Conan. Not only would they need to defeat the Picts, but this 
      monstrous beast as well.</p>",

      <p>Techotl smote on the bronze door with his clenched hand, and then turned sidewise, so that he could watch back along the hall. 
      “Men have been smitten down before this door, when they thought they were safe,” he said. He lifted his voice and called: “Open 
      the door, Xecelan! It is I, Techotl, with friends from the great world beyond the forest!—They will open,” he assured his allies. 
      “They’d better do it in a hurry, then,” said Conan grimly. “I hear something crawling along the floor beyond the hall.”</p>
      <p>Techotl went ashy again and attacked the door with his fists, screaming: “Open, you fools, open! The Crawler is at our heels!”</p>",

      <p><span class="special_title">Doors:</span> The door with the red border can only be opened by a Hero using Wall Wrecker. The 
      door with the blue border opens automatically when the Dragon of Xuchotl is killed or if the Energy Globe is shattered. All 
      other doors can be opened with a simple Manipulation.</p>

      an area with a facedown Treasure token <img src="/assets/tokens/treasureToken.png" class="scen_token" /> may perform a simple 
      Manipulation to search for components. Flip the token. If the number of the reverse side is 1, the item is trash: remove it 
      from the game. If the number is 2, the item is usable: keep it. These tokens have an Encumbrance value of 0 and may be dropped, 
      thrown, or traded like other items. As a free action, a Hero with four tokens may exchange them for the Tools card.</p>

      same reason. In either case, the remaining Heroes recover gems as though two Heroes had died.</p>

        taverns.</p>
      <p>In one of these taverns, a wild-eyed drunkard is telling an insane story in exchange for drinks to anyone who will listen. 
      He claims to have discovered a tomb filled with ancient treasures to the east, at the foot of the Mountains of Fire, and asserts 
      that he alone survived from his expedition. His gaze freezes into emptiness as he tells of the unspeakable horror they had to 
      face and the massacre of his companions.</p>
      <p>Amidst the mockery and insults, groups of mercenaries listen to him attentively, each one imagining their share of the loot. 
      Fueled by the thirst for the crazy riches described by the drunkard, two expeditions hastily form and head towards the tomb. Who

      <p>South of Khitai, lies a cursed swamp that is said to shelter the tomb of an ancient sorcerer from the Scarlet Circle. 
      Many men have ventured into these hostile lands in search of his tomb and the jade scepter buried with him. None have ever

      leave the quagmire to find some rest. Just as the faint light of the moon manages to pierce the surrounding mist, another group 
      of adventurers approaches the camp, determined to claim it for themselves. The first blows are barely exchanged when inhuman 
      groans are heard. Petrified, the men cease their fighting in the face of the nightmare scene unfolding all around them: 
      putrefied corpses armed with swords corroded by rust emerge from the swamp to attack them. The two groups will have to put 
      aside their differences until sunrise if they hope to survive this night from a nightmare.</p>',

      <p>In the heart of unforgiving Stygia, in the province of Kheshatta, dark sorcerers are conducting experiments that challenge 
      the very fabric of reality. In utmost secrecy, the terrifying Amenhotep has been crossbreeding all manner of monsters and demons 
      for years, in the hopes of creating an abomination powerful enough to overthrow the pharaoh and claim the throne of Stygia for 
        himself. After each manipulation, the sorcerer puts his new chimera to the test by pitting it against slaves, prisoners, or any 
        other victims he has captured.</p>
      <p>This time, the necromancer has lured two teams of mercenaries whom he has drugged and thrown into his catacombs, promising 
      freedom to the group that manages to defeat his creation. But the sorcerer is playful; he has decided to deprive them of their 
      weap- ons to make the task a little less easy.</p>
      <p>The mercenaries barely have time to emerge from the drug-induced fog before the ground begins to shake and open up around 
      them, revealing huge, twisted tentacles. They have little time to react. They will have to retrieve weapons from the corpses 
      strewn about and be the first to destroy the creature.</p>',

      <p>Shadizar is known throughout Hyboria as the capital of the kingdom of Zamora, but also as a corrupted city, a den of

      with impunity.</p>
      <p>There is no shortage of candidates to swell the ranks of the brotherhood, and tradition dictates that new recruits prove 
      their worth by undergoing a rite of passage during which their skills at theft and murder are put to the test. This time, their 
      target will be a fortress of the neighboring Corinthia, at the foot of the Karpash Mountains. This stronghold houses compromising 
      documents that their employer wishes to appropriate, likely for use in some political plot.</p>
      <p>But that matters little to the assassins. They have a contract, an objective, and have already received their payment. They 
      care for nothing else. As they advance towards the fortress, the defenders seem to be waiting for them, as if warned of their

      there is a relic eons old that grants immortality to anyone who possesses it. Conan and his allies set off in search of this 
      powerful artefact, which has the power to give them infinite wealth and glory. After they arrive, they discover the entrance to 
      the catacombs hidden behind a mound of human bones. As they enter the stone labyrinth, the walls seem to come alive, closing 
      behind them and transforming the layout of the maze. A supernatural scream suddenly echoes through the tunnels, as if a dark 
      presence lurking in the shadows had been awakened by the moving walls. What sorcery fills these hateful halls? Regardless, the

        have haunted the area for generations, long before he and his ancestors were born.</p>

        patterns similar to the ones they have just seen. According to the Stygian scrolls he has studied, these people were forced 
        to flee their native city to escape endless war and famine. Their exodus took them northwards to the marshes in the wilderness, 
        where they settled. So far, no one has ever been foolish enough to explore these lands and see if these tales were true.</p>

        skeletal faces, frozen in terror, seem to be screaming at the mercenaries to turn around and run.</p>
        <p>Ignoring this warning, they continue on their way, guided by little more than the exceptional skills of their marauder, 
        who has managed to pick up tracks leading through this murky, shifting environment.</p>
        <p>After a long and arduous walk, a blurry shape emerges from the fog. It appears to </p>

        <p>be a wooden hut perched on stilts eaten away by damp and mold. Before long, other buildings appear and reveal an entire 
        village filled with the crazy soldiers they fought earlier!</p>
        <p>They seem to be in the right place, and the sight of Ilona, wrists bound as she is dragged roughly into one of the huts, 
        dispels any lingering doubts. She is followed by a hauntingly beautiful but sinister- looking woman whose eyes glow with 
        fascinating yet terrifying hypnotic intensity.</p>
        <p>An occult ceremony is being prepared in the centre of the village. The mercenaries have seen enough in their countless 
        adventures to know that it involves the sacrifice of a young woman.</p>
        <p>There’s no time to lose!</p>

        <p><span class="setup_item">Special Rules</span></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Game Board Rules:</span> Standard game board rules apply except the “Water areas” rule which 
        doesn’t affect the Overlord units.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Ilona:</span> She cannot suffer damage and does not count towards hindering.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Free Ilona:</span> A Hero in Ilona’s area may perform a complex Manipulation with a difficulty 
        of 4 to free her. The Lockpicking Skill can be used. If successful, remove the Rope token from the base of her miniature and 
        place it next to the board.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6">
      <p></p><p></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Escort Ilona:</span> A Hero in Ilona’s area without the Rope token may perform a simple 
        Manipulation to move her miniature to an adjacent area ignoring hindering. If the Rope token is on her miniature’s base, 
        the Manipulation is complex with a difficulty of 1. If successful, move her miniature to an adjacent area ignoring hindering, 
        remove the Rope token from her base and place it next to the board.</p>
        <p>Each Hero cannot escort Ilona more than once per Turn.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Escape with Ilona:</span> A Hero in the area marked 
        <img src="/assets/tokens/area1Token.png" class="scen_token" /> with Ilona may spend movement points as if they were crossing 
        a border to escape the swamp with her. Once a Hero has escaped, they cannot return to the board and still count for the 
        number of Activation tokens to be drawn.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Additional Objective:</span> When Ilona is freed for the first time, she finds her courage and 
        asks for your help before escaping this wretched place. Roll <img src="/assets/dice/Orange.png" class="scen_sq_token" />  (no 
        rerolls). The number of successes indicates the additional objective to achieve.
          <ul>
            <li>0 success: Retrieve her father’s stolen goods. The Heroes must open all the chests.</li>
            <li>1 success: Burn this cursed village. The Heroes must burn the village.</li>
            <li>2 successes: Take revenge on Tascela. The Heroes must kill Tascela.</li>
          </ul></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Burn the village:</span> A Hero in a hut area may perform a complex Manipulation 
        with a difficulty of 2 to set the hut on fire. If successful, place a Flame token in the hut area. There are 6 huts, and 
        there can be only one Flame token per hut. When all 6 huts are set on fire, the village is burned.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Tascela:</span> She targets the Strongest Hero.
          <ul>
            <li><span class="special_solo_title">Fascination:</span> Each turn, the first Attack targeting her must reroll the 
            die with the highest number of successes. This Special rule replaces the Fascination Skill.</li>
            <li><span class="special_solo_title">Spellcaster:</span> Tascela has the Soul Leech spell. At the end of her 
            activation, she casts it targeting the Strongest Hero.</li>

        <p>On the way back to Argos, Ilona recounts what she learned from her captors. Tascela and her people come from a cursed city, 
        far to the south in the Black Kingdoms, where they were banished more than two centuries ago for their unholy practice of dark 
        magic. They have managed to prolong their existence thanks to the supernatural powers of the witch, who is capable of sucking 
        the youth out of one body and passing it on to another. They have sacrificed tens of thousands of victims in their ceremonies - 
        which explains the myths and legends that have surrounded these marshes for generations. Over time, the marshland where they 
        found refuge has become a prison in which they are condemned to wander for all eternity.</p>
        <p>Naum falls to his knees when he sees his daughter safe and sound, and the generous bounty he pays the mercenaries allows 
        them to enjoy endless excess and luxury for many nights in the exotic taverns and inns of Argos. But all good things must come 
        to an end, and after squandering their pay our mercenaries return to their adventures, penniless. That, however, is a story for 
        another time...</p>

        <p>The King of the Heather had been warned: invoking the Worms of the Earth would bring only darkness and ruin. But to 
        protect his people–to spit back in the eye of Rome–what else was Bran Mak Morn to do? Having lost his grip on the Black 
          Stone, he no longer held dominion over the burrowing, subterranean fiends. Now a rumor suggests the Worms have a new

          as well as two trusted warriors, he must return to Dagon’s Mere, secure the stone, and send this necromancer screaming 
          to the depths of Hell!</p>

        Overlord units cannot pass through closed doors, and waste their activation if doors block all exits from their area.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Skuthus the Slippery:</span> When Skuthus activates, roll 
        <img src="/assets/dice/Red.png" class="scen_sq_token" /> (no rerolls allowed). If the result is:</p>
        <p>1 success - Place him in the area with the <img src="/assets/tokens/flameToken.png" class="scen_token" /> token.</p>
        <p>2 successes - Place him in the area with the <img src="/assets/tokens/flame2Token.png" class="scen_token" /> token.</p>

        <p>Then activate Skuthus. He casts Bori’s Rage rather than using his attack die.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">The Black Stone:</span> When Skuthus is killed, place the Black Stone token 
        <img src="/assets/tokens/blackStoneToken.png" class="scen_token" /> in his area. A Hero may pick up the Black Stone with a 
        simple Manipulation. It has an Encumbrance value of 0. Place the Outer Dark Demon in the reinforcement area 
        <img src="/assets/stats/reinforcement.png" class="scen_token" />. A Hero with the Black Stone may exit the game board from 
        the reinforcement area by <img src="/assets/stats/reinforcement.png" class="scen_token" /> spending movement points as

        <p>No man - not even Bran Mak Morn - can bridle the Worms of the Earth for long. Soon after a narrow victory, the pale 
        creatures slipped back into their subterranean lair and no appeals nor offerings would draw them out. Bran’s Pictish 
        brethren – having watched their leader command these fiends to terrible purpose – began doubting their leader’s mental 
        faculties. Some of them even turned coat, becoming servants of Rome. But these fools could not know what other horrors 
        lurked in the bowels of the earth.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>On the borders of Caledonia an ancient ruin looms. A small force of Roman soldiers seized the site as a base of operations 
        from where they could plan attacks against Pictish villages. Unbeknownst to them, just below the soil, a sleeping god stirs. 
        Perhaps it was the Worms of the Earth that roused the creature, or Roman sorcery run amok. In either case, Bran Mak Morn sees 
          an opportunity to take vengeance on his traitorous brethren, strike a blow to Rome, and save his lands from a creature beyond 
          the ken of human experience.</p>

        <p><span class="setup_item">Special Rules</span></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Game Board Rules:</span>Game Board Rules: Standard game board rules apply, except Rock 
        Slide areas are treated like regular areas; they do not cost extra movement points to enter. Overlord units will not leap 
          from walls.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Game Board Rules:</span>Tentacles: In this scenario, the Tentacles effectively serve as 
        tokens which denote areas from where Thaug can seize Heroes. They don’t have attributes and cannot be killed or removed from 
        the board.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Game Board Rules:</span>Bran’s Servants: Though they still bear the name, these creatures 
        no longer serve Bran Mak Morn. In fact, whenever they activate, they always attempt to target Bran. If they cannot reach him 
        for an attack, follow the rules for determining an Alternate Target Hero.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p></p><p></p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Game Board Rules:</span>Heads for a Hungry God: Thaug is only vulnerable once its belly 
        is full. Thus, the Heroes must feed it severed heads from the foes they kill. Whenever a Pict Hunter or a Bran’s Servant is 
        killed, lay their miniature down in their area. A Hero in an area with a laid-down miniature may harvest their head by 
        performing a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 1. If successful, remove the laid-down miniature from the board and 
        place a red gem next to the Hero’s sheet to denote they are now carrying a head. The head has an Encumbrance value of 1 and 
        may be dropped, passed, or thrown like an object. To feed the head to Thaug, a Hero needs to throw or drop the head in Thaug’s 
        area. A Hero may only carry one head at a time.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Game Board Rules:</span>Thaug: Whenever Thaug’s tile is activated, first move any Heroes 
        currently in an area with a Tentacle to Thaug’s area. If a Hero is carrying a head at this time, that head is sacrificed to 
        Thaug, contributing to the Heroes’ tally. Thaug then attacks, following standard rules for determining a Target Hero. Thaug 
        is only vulnerable to damage after it has been fed 5 heads.</p>

        <p><span class="special_solo_title">Game Board Rules:</span>Pictish Fetish: When a Hero carrying the Pictish Fetish attacks 
        Thaug, Thaug’s Armor value is reduced to 4 and may not use its Horror skill against this attack.</p>

      description: "<p>The Bossonian conquests had ventured far to the south into Stygian lands. “An abandoned fort? Stygian silence 
      is naught. By Crom, nothing but dread and destruction will follow in these cursed lands,” Conan replied sullenly, in stark 
      contrast with the commanders who celebrated their conquest over laughter and spilled wine. Meanwhile, knights were marching south.</p>
      <p>Conan’s warnings had gone unheeded, so he was not surprised when he received a letter weeks later to check upon the conquered 
      fort. However, he did not appreciate the subtle provocation to act immediately, as it mentioned that Bêlit and Hadrathus had 
      already been sent out to investigate. He had to ride fast. Mounting his trusted steed, Conan laid waste to the rustic fields of 
      Aquilonia that he had to traverse to reach the fort embedded deep within the southern marshes.</p>
      <p>Days of haste and adrenaline were replaced by the melancholic marshes, inviting Conan to slow his trot. Battling his feelings, 
      he finally reached his destination. There it lay as the sun had set, its walls dark and brooding, slowly being overtaken by the 
      night sky. The moon turned crimson-red and covered the bleak scenery with an unearthly, sinister mantle. He spotted his comrades 
      pressed against the wall, signaling him to lay low. At that moment, a creature with leathery wings rose from the fort, blotting out 
      the moonlight and accompanied by screams of madness and moral distress.</p>",
