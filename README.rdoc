== README

This is my Conan app (in progress).

It displays and cross-references information related to Monolith's boardgame Conan.

Ideally, a Scenario is fed by details from all the other sections. A user can follow links from the Scenario page back to the details' page for more information.

So far, All models, controller and pages are in. Data for Maps, Heroes, Tiles, Spell, Items, Skills and Stories are in.

...more to do.

The app is up on heroku:
